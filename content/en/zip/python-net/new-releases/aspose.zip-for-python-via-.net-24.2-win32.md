This release of Aspose.ZIP for Python via .NET (Win32) optimizes your Python applications with reliable ZIP archive creation, manipulation, and extraction capabilities.

### Consistent Handling of ZIP Archives

The Python archive management library now offers enhanced handling of corrupted ZIP data and allows seamless processing even with imperfect archives in a Windows x32 environment.

### Upgraded TAR Archive Support

Version 24.2 of the Python API enables developers to manage TAR archives exceeding 8GB in size efficiently. This update takes care of the previous limitations and lets developers work with larger ZIP archives on 32-bit Windows machines.
