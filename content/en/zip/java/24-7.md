## Release Highlights

Aspose.ZIP for Java 24.7 continues to broaden archive format compatibility with the addition of support for ISO (ISO 9660), Z (compress), Shar, FastLZ, and WavPack formats. This update enables developers to read, write, and extract data from a wider range of compressed and disk image formats with added stream-based compression enhancements and new metadata access methods.

## New Features

- **ISO Format Support**
  - Introduced `IsoArchive` and `IsoEntry` classes for reading ISO 9660 image files.

- **Z Format (compress) Support**
  - Added `ZArchive` and methods for saving Z-compressed TAR and CPIO archives.

- **Shar Archive Support**
  - Added `SharArchive` and `SharEntry` classes for Unix shar-format compatibility.

- **FastLZ Compression Support**
  - Introduced `FastLZOutputStream` to enable compression using FastLZ algorithm.

- **WavPack Algorithm Support**
  - Internal support added for WavPack algorithm as part of archive processing stack.

## Enhancements

- Added `.getLength()` and `.getName()` methods for:
  - `Bzip2Archive`, `GzipArchive`, `LzipArchive`, `LzmaArchive`

- Added support for header encryption configuration in 7z:
  - `SevenZipEncryptionSettings.getEncryptHeader()` / `.setEncryptHeader(boolean)`

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Classes**
  - `IsoArchive`, `IsoEntry`
  - `SharArchive`, `SharEntry`
  - `ZArchive`, `FastLZOutputStream`

- **New Methods**
  - Archive metadata access:
    - `.getLength()`, `.getName()` for multiple archive types
  - Z-compression saving support:
    - `TarArchive.saveZCompressed(...)`
    - `CpioArchive.saveZCompressed(...)`
    - `TarArchive.fromZ(...)`
  - 7z encryption setting:
    - `SevenZipEncryptionSettings.getEncryptHeader()` / `.setEncryptHeader(boolean)`

- **Deleted Methods**
  - `.dispose()` methods deprecated and replaced by `close()` across all archive classes:
    - e.g., `Archive.dispose()` → `close()`
