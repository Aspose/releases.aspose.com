# What's new in the Aspose.ZIP for Java 24.9

## Release Highlights

Aspose.ZIP for Java 24.9 introduces support for creating Self-Extracted (SFX) archives, along with detailed event-driven handling for ISO and XAR formats. This release also brings real-time progress reporting for multiple compression algorithms including LZMA, Zstandard, Z, and Bzip2—empowering developers to monitor and control large archive operations efficiently.

## New Features

- **Self-Extracted Archive (SFX) Format**
  - Added `SelfExtractorOptions` and `ArchiveSaveOptions.setSelfExtractorOptions()` for building executable archives.

- **Event Handling for ISO and XAR Archives**
  - New classes such as `EventsBagIso`, `EventsBagXar` with entry-level `EntryAccessed` and `EntryCompressed` events.
  - Load and save options now support progress and cancellation callbacks.

- **Progress Reporting Support**
  - Enabled for LZMA, Bzip2, Zstandard, and Z archives via `CompressionProgressed` and `ExtractionProgressed` events.

## Enhancements

- **Deferred Stream Initialization**
  - `Archive.CreateEntry()` now allows lazy stream creation using `Supplier<InputStream>`.

- **Metered Licensing Support for SFX**
  - Self-extracted archive creation is now available under metered license conditions.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Classes**
  - `SelfExtractorOptions`, `EventsBagXar`, `EventsBagIso`, `XarLoadOptions`, `IsoLoadOptions`, `ZArchiveLoadOptions`, `ZstandardSaveOptions`, and others related to event handling.

- **New Methods**
  - `ArchiveSaveOptions.setSelfExtractorOptions(SelfExtractorOptions)`
  - `EventsBagXar.setEntryAccessed(...)`, `setEntryCompressed(...)`
  - `LzmaArchiveSettings.setCompressionProgressed(...)`
  - `ZArchiveSaveOptions.setCompressionProgressed(...)`, and many more for real-time compression/extraction progress tracking.
