# What's new in the Aspose.ZIP for Java 25.5

## Release Highlights

Aspose.ZIP for Java 25.5 adds new capabilities for composing `.tar.lz4` archives, detecting uuencoded files by signature, and improving LZ4 compression behavior. Developers can now control block checksums and include original content size in LZ4 headers, while benefiting from reduced memory allocation during extraction.

## New Features

- **Detect UUEncoded Files by Signature**
  - Enables automatic detection of uuencoded files using signature analysis.

- **Compose TAR.LZ4 Archives**
  - Added support to save TAR archives compressed with LZ4 in a single operation.

## Enhancements

- **Include Block Checksum in LZ4**
  - Developers can enable `xxh32` checksum validation at the end of each compressed block.

- **Include Original Content Size in LZ4**
  - Option to embed the uncompressed content size directly into the LZ4 frame header.

- **Store Unix File Mode in UUEncoded Files**
  - Unix file permissions can now be stored within uuencoded files for better cross-platform compatibility.

- **Reduced Memory Allocation**
  - Improved efficiency during LZ4 extraction to lower memory usage.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Methods in `Lz4ArchiveSetting`**
  - `getIncludeContentSize()` / `setIncludeContentSize(boolean)`
  - `getIncludeBlockChecksum()` / `setIncludeBlockChecksum(boolean)`

- **New Method in `TarArchive`**
  - `saveLZ4Compressed(...)` — Saves a TAR archive with LZ4 compression in a single operation.
