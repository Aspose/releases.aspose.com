[Aspose.ZIP for Java](https://products.aspose.com/zip/java/) is a standalone Java API to create, manipulate, extract & protect archive formats including ZIP, BZIP, BZ2 & TAR.

Aspose.ZIP for Java class library allows your Java applications to compress/decompress files and folders without getting into the complexity of coding new compression algorithms or understanding the existing ones. Enable your programs to work with a vast range of features, such as creating archives, saving archives, archive extraction, encrypting/decrypting archives, compressing single or multiple files as well as directory contents. It also allows you to apply security to your archived and compressed files and folders via password, AES (128, 192, 256) encryption, or mixed encryption.

## Archive Processing Features

- Compress files and folders into standard ZIP formats.
- Supports `Deflate`, `Bzip2` & `LZMA` compression algorithm.
- Apply simple password or `AES128`, `AES192`, `AES256` encryption to archives.
- Employ different protection schemes for each file within an archive.
- Append more files to an existing zipped archive.
- Use `Gzip` or `Bzip2` to pack files & folders into a `TAR` archive.
- Supports `LZMA` or `LZMA2` compression & optional encryption to create `7z` archives.

### Read & Write ZIP Formats

ZIP, 7z, TAR, GZIP, BZ2

## Supported Environments

- **Microsoft Windows:** Windows Desktop & Server (x86, x64)
- **macOS:** Mac OS X
- **Linux:** Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, CentOS, and others
- **Java Versions:** `J2SE 8.0 (1.8)` or above

## Get Started

Aspose.ZIP Java APIs are hosted at the [Aspose Repository](https://releases.aspose.com/zip/java/). You can easily use Aspose.ZIP for Java API directly in your Maven projects with simple configurations. For the detailed instructions please visit [Installing Aspose.ZIP for Java from Maven Repository](https://docs.aspose.com/zip/java/installation/) documentation page.

## Creating a ZIP archive

```java
  String dir = "full directory path";
  try(Archive arch = new Archive()) {
    arch.createEntry("filename.dat", dir+"file.dat");
    arch.save(dir+"result.zip");
  }
```
