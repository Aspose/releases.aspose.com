# What's new in the Aspose.ZIP for Java 25.4

## Release Highlights

Aspose.ZIP for Java 25.4 introduces the ability to create `.lz4` archives and supports one-step extraction of `.tar.lz4` files. The release also enhances Unix file mode preservation for TAR and ZIP formats, reduces memory usage in LZMA decompression, and improves password validation for ZIP extraction.

## New Features

- **Compose LZ4 Archives**
  - Added methods to define source content and save `.lz4` archives programmatically using `Lz4Archive`.

## Enhancements

- **Unix File Mode Preservation**
  - File permissions are now stored in TAR headers and retained for both TAR and ZIP formats on Unix systems.
- **Efficient TAR.LZ4 Extraction**
  - Introduced `Tar.fromLZ4()` method to directly unpack `.tar.lz4` archives.
- **Optimized Memory Usage**
  - Reduced memory allocation during LZMA decompression of 7z files.
- **Improved Commentary Grammar**
  - Corrected textual output and in-archive metadata for clearer documentation.

## Bug Fixes

- **ZIP Password Validation**
  - Passwords are now verified before decompression for traditionally encrypted ZIP files, preventing indefinite blocking.
- **PPMD Compressed ZIP Blockage**
  - Fixed issue causing application to hang when processing ZIPs with PPMD compression.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Added Methods**
  - `Lz4Archive.setSource(...)` — Sets the input source for `.lz4` archive creation.
  - `Lz4Archive.save(...)` — Saves the archive to a stream or file.
  - `Tar.fromLZ4(...)` — Extracts `.tar.lz4` archive in a single operation.
