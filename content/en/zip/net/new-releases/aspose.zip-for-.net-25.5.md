#### Release Highlights

Aspose.ZIP for .NET 25.5 delivers enhanced support for legacy formats, introduces TAR with LZ4 compression, and improves memory efficiency and metadata preservation in LZ4 archives.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Uuencoded File Detection**:
  - The API now automatically detects uuencoded files by their content signature, enabling smoother processing of this legacy format.

- **Tar.LZ4 Combined Archive Creation**:
  - New method `TarArchive.SaveLZ4Compressed()` allows developers to compose and save `.tar.lz4` archives in one step.

### üîß Enhancement

- **LZ4 Metadata Control**:
  - `Lz4ArchiveSetting.IncludeContentSize`: Optionally include the original file size in the LZ4 header.
  - `Lz4ArchiveSetting.IncludeBlockChecksum`: Enables inclusion of `xxh32` block checksum for improved integrity.

- **LZ4 Extraction Optimization**:
  - Memory allocation on LZ4 extraction has been significantly reduced, leading to faster and more efficient decompression.

- **Uuencoded File Metadata**:
  - Unix file mode metadata is now preserved when handling uuencoded files for better cross-platform compatibility.

### üõ† Fix

- **Unix File Mode Handling**:
  - Fixed issue where Unix file mode was not applied correctly if the file wasn‚Äôt explicitly supplied during archive composition.
