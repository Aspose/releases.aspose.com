#### Release Highlights

The DLLs-only release of Aspose.ZIP for .NET 24.10 focuses on improved archive structure access, safer memory handling, and reliable multi-format extraction.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Zip Entry Source Disposal**:  
  With `ArchiveSaveOptions.CloseEntrySource`, developers can configure whether to automatically dispose of entry sources after compression‚Äîideal for memory-sensitive workflows.

- **Unified ISO Entry Model**:  
  `IsoEntry` now follows a standardized interface and exposes both `Extract()` and `Length` for consistent archive access patterns.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Access to Entry Sources**:  
  Use the new `ArchiveEntry.DataSource` property to retrieve the original input stream of a composed zip entry.

- **Memory Optimization for Bzip2**:  
  Internally optimizes buffer usage during Bzip2 compression using array renting to reduce allocations.

### üõ† Fix

- **XAR SaveOptions Fix**:  
  Corrected behavior where XAR archives saved by path did not honor the provided save options.

- **Snappy Archive Output**:  
  Fixed output issues affecting Snappy-compressed files, ensuring proper structure and data alignment.

- **7z Archive Compatibility**:  
  Extracting 7z archives that contain empty folders now completes as expected.
