#### Release Highlights

Aspose.ZIP for .NET 25.4 expands LZ4 support, enhances Unix permission handling during archive creation and extraction, and improves decompression performance for 7z files.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **LZ4 Archive Creation**:
  - New support for composing `.lz4` archives using:
    - `Lz4Archive.SetSource()`: Define source content.
    - `Lz4Archive.Save()`: Write the LZ4 archive to disk.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Unix Permissions in Archives**:
  - **TAR Enhancements**:
    - Unix file mode now preserved in the TAR header.
    - File permissions set correctly during extraction on Unix systems.
  - **ZIP Enhancements**:
    - ZIP entries now store Unix file mode and apply it on extraction under Unix-based OS.

- **Single-Step TAR.LZ4 Extraction**:
  - New static method `Tar.FromLZ4()` allows you to extract `.tar.lz4` compressed archives in one streamlined operation.

- **LZMA Performance Optimization**:
  - Reduced memory allocation for LZMA decompression improves performance and efficiency when handling large 7z files.

- **Improved Commentary Clarity**:
  - Adjusted internal comments and log grammar for improved developer readability.

### üõ† Fix

- **Password Verification for Encrypted ZIPs**:
  - Fixed issue where traditional ZIP encryption would delay password validation until after decompression. Now fails fast on incorrect passwords, improving security and performance.
