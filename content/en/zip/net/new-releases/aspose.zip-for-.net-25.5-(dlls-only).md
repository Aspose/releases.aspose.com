#### Release Highlights

Aspose.ZIP for .NET 25.5 DLLs bring greater compression flexibility and legacy format support, including `.tar.lz4` creation and uuencode detection, along with efficiency gains and bug fixes.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Detect Uuencoded Files by Signature**:
  - Adds the ability to recognize and process uuencoded files without requiring format-specific flags.

- **TAR with LZ4 Output**:
  - Compose compressed `.tar.lz4` archives using `TarArchive.SaveLZ4Compressed()`.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Configurable LZ4 Archive Properties**:
  - `IncludeContentSize`: Controls whether the archive frame stores the uncompressed size.
  - `IncludeBlockChecksum`: Adds a checksum per block to ensure data integrity.

- **Efficient LZ4 Decompression**:
  - Memory use during LZ4 archive extraction is optimized for improved speed and lower system load.

- **Unix File Mode Support**:
  - Uuencoded files and other entries now retain Unix permissions for accurate file restoration across platforms.

### üõ† Fix

- **Unix Mode Handling Fix**:
  - Corrected an issue where file mode was not applied on Unix systems if the archive was missing file metadata explicitly.
