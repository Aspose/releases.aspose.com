#### Release Highlights

The DLLs-only release of Aspose.ZIP for .NET 24.12 adds deeper extraction capabilities across archive formats, particularly for LHA and 7z files using specialized compression schemes.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **LHA Adaptive Huffman Decompression**:
  - Now fully supports decompression of `.lha` entries using adaptive Huffman‚Äîenabling extraction of files from legacy archives that use this algorithm.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Delta-Encoded 7z Support**:
  - Added ability to extract 7z archive entries compressed with Delta encoding.
  - New constant added:
    - `SevenZipCompressionMethod.Delta`: Identifies Delta-compressed data within the 7z structure.

This enables broader compatibility with software distributions and data sets using differential compression.

### üõ† Fix

- *No bugs were reported or fixed in this release.*
