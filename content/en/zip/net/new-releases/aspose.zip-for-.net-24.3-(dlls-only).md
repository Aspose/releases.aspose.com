The Aspose.ZIP for .NET 24.3 (DLLs-only package) release is here to elevate your development experience! This update introduces Zstandard compression for significant file size reduction and expands Cpio archive handling with various compression options.

### Introducing Zstandard Compression

Zstandard is an intricate compression algorithm, that offers high-quality archive size scaling within your .NET solutions running on the Windows, Linux, or Mac platforms. Aspose.ZIP for .NET now supports Zstandard compression, providing a new avenue for you to explore and implement into your apps.

### Flexible Cpio Archives

The C# ZIP archives library provides extensive support for Cpio archives and lets you conveniently work with formats compressed with Lzip, LZMA, Z, and Zstandard.

### New Public APIs

Streamline your workflows with new public APIs designed to interact with Zstandard archives and Cpio archives with diverse compression methods. The following public API members were added in this release: 

- Aspose.Zip.Zstandard.ZstandardArchive	
- Aspose.Zip.Cpio.CpioArchive.SaveLzipped(…)	
- Aspose.Zip.Cpio.CpioArchive.SaveLZMACompressed(…)
