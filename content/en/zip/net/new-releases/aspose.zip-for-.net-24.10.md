#### Release Highlights

Aspose.ZIP for .NET 24.10 introduces improvements in resource management, ISO archive functionality, and bug fixes across Snappy, XAR, and 7z formats.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Dispose Entry Sources After Save**:  
  New `ArchiveSaveOptions.CloseEntrySource` property allows automatic disposal of entry data streams post-compression, enhancing memory and file handle management.
  
- **ISO Archive Interface Unification**:  
  `IsoEntry` now implements `IArchiveFileEntry` and includes a new `Extract()` method and `Length` property for consistent access and streamlined ISO operations.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Expose Entry Source**:  
  Developers can now retrieve the original source of a zip archive entry via the new `ArchiveEntry.DataSource` property.
  
- **Bzip2 Performance Optimization**:  
  Internal improvements using buffer renting to reduce memory overhead during Bzip2 compression operations.

### üõ† Fix

- **XAR SaveOptions Applied Correctly**:  
  Fixed issue where save options were not passed when saving a XAR archive by file path.

- **Snappy Output Correction**:  
  Resolved data integrity issues affecting Snappy-compressed archives.

- **7z Archive Bug Fixed**:  
  Extracting archives that include empty folders now works correctly.
