#### Release Highlights

The DLLs-only release of Aspose.ZIP for .NET 25.1 introduces support for ARJ archive extraction, improves metadata handling in LHA entries, and eliminates unnecessary dependencies for .NET Framework 4.6.1+.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **ARJ Archive Support Added**:
  - New `ArjArchive` and `ArjEntryPlain` types allow loading, reading, and extracting `.arj` archives.
  - Access metadata such as `Name`, `Commentary`, and file sizes via new properties.
  - Extract entire archives or individual entries using simple, consistent APIs.

### üîß Enhancement

- **LHA Entry Enhancements**:
  - `LhaArchiveEntry` now exposes:
    - `IsDirectory`: Detect whether the entry is a directory.
    - `LastModified`: Retrieve the last modified timestamp.
  - Removed `LhaDirectoryEntry` for simplified entry handling.

- **Framework Optimization**:
  - Cleaned up legacy dependencies for .NET Framework 4.6.1 and newer, improving project integration and reducing deployment size.

### üõ† Fix

- **Stream Validation for LHA**:
  - Prevents extraction attempts from invalid or abnormally short streams in LHA archives to ensure runtime stability.
