#### Release Highlights

Aspose.ZIP for .NET 24.11 expands its archive format support with the addition of LHA extraction capabilities, enabling developers to work with legacy `.lha` and `.lzh` archives natively.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **LHA Archive Extraction Support**:
  - Added new `LhaArchive` class to load and extract `.lha` and `.lzh` archives.
  - Supports both file and directory entries with full access to names, lengths, and structured output.
  - New APIs include:
    - `LhaArchive.Entries` and `Directories`
    - `LhaArchive.ExtractToDirectory()`
    - `LhaArchiveEntry.Extract()`, `Name`, and `Length`
    - `LhaDirectoryEntry.ExtractToDirectory()` and `Name`

This update enables integration with older Japanese and DOS-era compression formats still used in industrial and archival systems.
