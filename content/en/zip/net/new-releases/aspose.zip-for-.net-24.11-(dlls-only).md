#### Release Highlights

The DLLs-only release of Aspose.ZIP for .NET 24.11 introduces a new archive format to the library‚ÄîLHA‚Äîenabling direct extraction of legacy compressed files used in archival and software distribution workflows.

- **Full LHA Archive Support**:
  - Added the `LhaArchive` class for reading `.lha` and `.lzh` files.
