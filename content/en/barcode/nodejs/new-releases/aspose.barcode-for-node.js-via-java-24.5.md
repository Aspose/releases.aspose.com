### Accurate Unicode Detection in QR Codes

Generate QR codes that can handle a wider range of characters efficiently, including those from various languages, thanks to improved Unicode character detection.

### Enhanced `DataMatrix` Quality Control

The newly introduced `QualitySettings` structure for the `DataMatrix` barcode engine in Aspose.BarCode for Node.js via Java 24.5 empowers you to fine-tune the quality of generated codes and ensures optimal readability.

### Bug Fixes and Refinements

This Node.js barcode API release addresses several bugs related to `DotCode` barcode generation, `Standard2of5` and `IATA2of5` encoding, QR code recognition, and unexpected `DecodeType` detection.

### Improved Public API Consistency

As part of our ongoing commitment to API clarity and maintainability, we've removed deprecated constructors and methods from the public API. This streamlines the development process and reduces the risk of compatibility issues in future updates.
