## Public API changes and backwards compatibility

### Recognition quality and speed of NDTBase processors
Recognition quality and speed of ***NDTBase*** processors was improved. 
These improvements include the following symbologies: Code128, Code16K, Supplement, UPCE, Code39, Code39FullASCII.

### BarcodeGenerator API updated
Updated SetCodeText functions for charset encodings. 
Currently we have two variant of the function: with selection of BOM (byte order mark) insertion and without.

Updated the setCodeText methods for character set encodings.
We currently have two variants of the method: 
one that allows BOM (byte order mark) insertion selection and one without this option.

```java
    //Encode codetext of 2D barcodes with UTF8 encoding with byte order mark (BOM)
    BarcodeGenerator generator = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.CODE_128);
    generator.setCodeText("123ABCD", StandardCharsets.UTF_8, true);
    generator.save("barcode.png", BarCodeImageFormat.PNG);

    //Encode codetext of 2D barcodes with UTF8 encoding without byte order mark (BOM)
    BarcodeGenerator generator = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.CODE_128);
    generator.setCodeText("123ABCD", StandardCharsets.UTF_8, false);
    generator.save("barcode.png", BarCodeImageFormat.PNG);
```

### Recognition quality stability
Fixes to barcode area detector were added which improves barcodes recognition stability in multi-threaded environment.
