# What's new in the Aspose.BarCode for Java 23.7

## Release Highlights

Aspose.BarCode for Java 23.7 introduces a major overhaul of the DataMatrix generation engine. It adds new encoding modes, dozens of predefined ECC200/ECC000/DMRE versions, structured append options, and extended codetext builder functionality. Additionally, it resolves a critical Reed-Solomon correction issue affecting decodability.

## Enhancements

- **Improved DataMatrix Encoder**  
  Optimized engine for greater flexibility, reliability, and configurability across all ECC levels and sizes.

- **Extended Codetext and Encoding Control**  
  New builder class `DataMatrixExtCodetextBuilder` allows mixing ECI segments, encode modes (C40, BYTES, etc.), and plain text in a single barcode.

- **Structured Append Support**  
  Enables split DataMatrix barcodes across multiple symbols with file and barcode ID management.

- **New `DataMatrixEncodeMode` Value: `BYTES`**  
  Supports binary input for more control over raw data representation.

## Bug Fixes

- **Reed-Solomon Correction Failure**  
  Fixed error-correction bug where the algorithm failed to decode even correctable DataMatrix symbols.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

### ✅ Added

- `DataMatrixVersion` class with dozens of named size/version presets  
- `DataMatrixEncodeMode.BYTES`  
- `DataMatrixExtCodetextBuilder` class and its methods  
- New properties in `DataMatrixParameters`:
  - Structured append: `getStructuredAppendBarcodeId`, `getStructuredAppendBarcodesCount`, `getStructuredAppendFileId`
  - Reader programming, macro characters, ECI encoding

- `BarCodeExtendedParameters.getDataMatrix()` and `DataMatrixExtendedParameters` with full structured append metadata

### ❌ Removed

- Obsolete encode modes:
  - `DataMatrixEncodeMode.FULL`  
  - `DataMatrixEncodeMode.CUSTOM`
