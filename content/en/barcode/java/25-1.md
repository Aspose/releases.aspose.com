# What's new in Aspose.BarCode for Java 25.1

## Release Highlights

Aspose.BarCode for Java 25.1 introduces significant recognition quality improvements for various 1D barcode symbologies by extending the QualitySettings structure to NBase and WBase processors. This release also debuts an experimental **PDF encoder**, enhancing output versatility, and resolves multiple bugs including incorrect USPS OneCode decoding and rotation rendering issues.

## New Features

- **Experimental PDF Barcode Export:**
  Added the ability to generate barcodes directly in PDF vector format using the `BarCodeImageFormat.PDF` option. This provides sharp output ideal for print workflows.

- **Enhanced QualitySettings for NBase and WBase Processors:**
  Improves recognition accuracy and performance for symbologies like Code128, GS1Code128, CodablockF, Codabar, Code39, ITF14, and many others.

## Bug Fixes

- **USPS OneCode Recognition Bug Fixed:**
  Corrected decoding issues with barcodes starting with "00", ensuring accurate results in postal applications.

- **Rotation Error Resolved:**
  Fixed a rendering issue where barcodes set to `RotationAngle = 45` degrees would throw a `BarCodeException`.

- **Various Recognition Accuracy Fixes:**
  Addressed multiple edge cases across GS1Code128, SSCC-18, MailmarkCodetext, and PZN barcodes where misreads or exceptions were reported.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- Introduced support for **`BarCodeImageFormat.PDF`** in the `BarcodeGenerator.save()` method.
- Recognition quality improved for multiple symbologies without any breaking changes.
