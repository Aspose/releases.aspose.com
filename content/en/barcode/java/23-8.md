# What's new in the Aspose.BarCode for Java 23.8

## Release Highlights

Aspose.BarCode for Java 23.8 enhances barcode recognition engines and adds new API for advanced Han Xin encoding. It significantly improves accuracy for DataMatrix Industrial and Han Xin codes while introducing new features for Micro PDF417 and configurable restoration settings.

## Enhancements

- **HanXinExtCodetextBuilder Introduced**  
  A powerful new builder class for creating extended Han Xin barcodes with support for multiple data types, ECI, GS1, Unicode, and regional Chinese character sets.

- **Improved Micro PDF417 Reader**  
  Enhancements to Micro PDF417 decoding ensure higher recognition rates across diverse image sources.

- **Optimized Color Binarization Algorithm**  
  Replaced the internal algorithm with a faster, more accurate binarization method for image pre-processing.

- **DataMatrix Industrial Recognition Enhanced**  
  Significant reliability gains for industrial-grade DataMatrix symbols, even in challenging environments.

## Bug Fixes

- **Fixed DataMatrix Performance Regression**  
  Restored recognition performance that had degraded in previous versions.

- **Fixed Crash with Empty String Input**  
  Resolved `IndexOutOfRangeException` when generating a barcode from an empty string.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

### ✅ Added

- **New Class:**  
  - `HanXinExtCodetextBuilder` with rich `add...()` methods including:
    - `addGB18030TwoByte`, `addGB18030FourByte`, `addNumeric`, `addURI`, `addGS1`, `addCommonChineseRegionOne`, etc.

- **Recognition Improvements:**  
  - `QualitySettings.getAllowAdditionalRestorations()`  
  - `QualitySettings.setAllowAdditionalRestorations(boolean)`  
  - `Pdf417ExtendedParameters.isReaderInitialization()`

These features offer advanced control over restoration and barcode content structuring.
