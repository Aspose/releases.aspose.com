# What's new in Aspose.BarCode for Java 25.2

## Release Highlights

Aspose.BarCode for Java 25.2 enhances barcode recognition accuracy and performance by extending QualitySettings support to the **NDTBase processor** group. This release also introduces updated `setCodeText` API methods with **byte order mark (BOM) control**, allowing greater flexibility in character encoding for barcode generation.

## New Features

- **Enhanced NDTBase Recognition Support:**
  Improvements in recognition speed and accuracy for symbologies like Code128, Code16K, Supplement, UPCE, Code39, and Code39FullASCII.

- **Advanced CodeText Encoding Options:**
  The `BarcodeGenerator.setCodeText()` method now includes overloads that allow enabling or disabling **BOM insertion** for precise encoding control, especially useful for QR and Code128 barcodes.

## Enhancements

- **Image Consistency Fix:**
  Resolved issues where different image generation paths produced inconsistent output.

- **Multithreading Stability:**
  Improved recognition consistency and performance in concurrent processing environments by refining the barcode area detector.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- New overloads for `setCodeText(String codeText, Charset encoding, boolean insertBom)` added.
- NDTBase processors benefit from enhanced quality settings without any breaking API changes.
