# What's new in Aspose.BarCode for Java 24.5

## Release Highlights

Aspose.BarCode for Java 24.5 introduces enhanced recognition for Unicode QR barcodes and extends the modular QualitySettings structure to the DataMatrix engine. Additionally, this version addresses critical bugs in DotCode sizing, QR and 2of5 patterns, and optimizes the API by removing obsolete constructors and methods.

## Enhancements

- **Unicode Charset Detection for QR Barcodes:**  
  QR barcode engine now supports automatic detection of Unicode character sets, ensuring better recognition of multilingual content.

- **Extended QualitySettings to DataMatrix Engine:**  
  The new quality-focused recognition framework now fully supports DataMatrix barcodes, enabling more precise decoding under varying conditions.

- **API Cleanup and Refinement:**  
  Multiple legacy constructors and methods have been deprecated and removed for a more streamlined and secure API:
  - `Code128DataPortion` constructor
  - `AustraliaPostSettings` constructors
  - `BarcodeSettings` constructors
  - `QualitySetting.applyAll()`
  - `Code128DataPortion.setData(String)`

## Bug Fixes

- **DotCode Issues Resolved:**
  - Fixed incorrect DotCode barcode sizing.
  - Corrected Reed-Solomon error encoding in DotCode generation.

- **Standard2of5 & IATA2of5 Enhancements:**  
  - Fixed incorrect bar width in start/stop patterns for 2of5 barcode types.

- **Improved QR Code Recognition:**  
  - Addressed regression in QR decoding reliability.

- **Detection Accuracy Fixes:**
  - Resolved issues where BarCodeReader detected incorrect or unspecified barcode types.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

### Removed

- Constructor: `Code128DataPortion`
- Constructor: `AustraliaPostSettings`
- Constructor: `BarcodeSettings`
- Method: `QualitySetting.applyAll()`
