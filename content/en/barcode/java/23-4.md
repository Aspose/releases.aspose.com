# What's new in the Aspose.BarCode for Java 23.4

## Release Highlights

Aspose.BarCode for Java 23.4 brings visual enhancements and API cleanup. This release introduces anti-aliasing support for barcode and text rendering, explores multithreading improvements for DataMatrix detection, and removes obsolete properties to simplify the public API.

## Enhancements

- **Anti-Aliasing Support Added**  
  A new `useAntiAlias` property enables smooth rendering of barcodes and text, enhancing visual clarity in generated images.

- **Optimized DataMatrix Detection with Multithreading**  
  Internally investigated and enhanced region detection algorithms for DataMatrix to benefit from multithreading, improving recognition speed in parallel environments.

- **Deprecated API Cleanup**  
  Multiple outdated methods related to barcode sizing, color, and checksum handling have been removed to streamline the API and avoid confusion.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

### ✅ Added

- **Anti-Aliasing Properties and Methods**  
  - `BaseGenerationParameters.setUseAntiAlias(boolean)`  
  - `BaseGenerationParameters.getUseAntiAlias()`  
  - `BarCodeGeneratorControl.setUseAntiAlias(boolean)`  
  - `BarCodeGeneratorControl.isUseAntiAlias()`

### ❌ Removed (Obsolete)

- AutoSizeMode, BarCodeHeight, BarCodeWidth, ForeColor setters/getters  
- `BarCodeReader` methods for:
  - `setChecksumValidation(...)`  
  - `setStripFNC(boolean)`  
  - `setCustomerInformationInterpretingType(...)`  
  - `setDetectEncoding(boolean)`  

These changes remove outdated functionality in favor of updated and cleaner barcode generation and recognition workflows.
