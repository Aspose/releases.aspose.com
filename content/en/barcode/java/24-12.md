# What's new in Aspose.BarCode for Java 24.12

## Release Highlights

Aspose.BarCode for Java 24.12 introduces enhanced QualitySettings support for the 1D barcode engine, aligning it with other symbologies. This release also fixes a critical bug that caused `MaxiCodeStructuredCodetext.getConstructedCodetext()` to throw a `NullPointerException`.

## Enhancements

- **Extended QualitySettings for 1D Barcode Engine:**
  The QualitySettings structure introduced in earlier versions is now fully supported for 1D barcodes, allowing finer control over detection quality, speed, and error handling.

## Bug Fixes

- **Fixed `NullPointerException` in `MaxiCodeStructuredCodetext.getConstructedCodetext()`:**
  This method now handles internal data more safely and no longer throws exceptions when accessed in uninitialized states.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

There are **no changes** to the public API in this release.
