# What's new in the Aspose.BarCode for Java 24.2

## Release Highlights

Aspose.BarCode for Java 24.2 delivers major improvements in barcode generation and recognition. This update adds support for rMQR barcodes, significantly enhances the QualitySettings API, and resolves multiple critical issues related to barcode detection accuracy, including DotCode and Micro QR recognition.

## New Features

- **Support for rMQR Barcodes**  
  Introduced support for the rectangular Micro QR (rMQR) symbology, expanding the variety of 2D barcodes supported.

- **Updated QualitySettings API**  
  The `QualitySettings` API has been redesigned with new enums and methods for advanced control over barcode recognition quality, image inversion, background complexity, and deconvolution settings. Legacy properties have been deprecated for a more streamlined approach.

## Enhancements

- **Multilingual License Compatibility**  
  License engine updated to accept characters beyond the ASCII standard, improving compatibility with multilingual environments.
  
- **Improved Recognition Accuracy**  
  Fixed issues with DotCode, Micro QR, DataMatrix, and PDF147 barcode recognition from TIFF and other image formats.

## Bug Fixes

- **BARCODENET-38868** – Fixed DotCode detection failure.
- **BARCODEJAVA-17** – Resolved DataMatrix recognition issue from TIFF.
- **BARCODEJAVA-683** – Corrected Micro QR code recognition output.
- **BARCODEJAVA-1430** – Improved detection and decoding of DataMatrix.
- **BARCODEJAVA-1742** – Fixed missing barcode labels in PDF147 and QR outputs.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Enums Introduced**:
  - `XDimensionMode`
  - `BarcodeQualityMode`
  - `DeconvolutionMode`
  - `InverseImageMode`
  - `ComplexBackgroundMode`

- **New `QualitySettings` Methods**:
  - `setXDimension`, `getXDimension`, `setMinimalXDimension`, `getMinimalXDimension`
  - `setBarcodeQuality`, `getBarcodeQuality`, etc.
  - Preset quality profiles: `getHighPerformance`, `getNormalQuality`, `getHighQuality`, `getMaxQuality`

- **Removed API Members**: Numerous legacy `QualitySettings` and `BarcodeSvmDetectorSettings` methods and properties.

- **New Barcode Types Added**:
  - `RECT_MICRO_QR` and `MICRO_QR` in `EncodeTypes` and `DecodeType`
  - `MicroQRVersion` and `RectMicroQRVersion` enums
