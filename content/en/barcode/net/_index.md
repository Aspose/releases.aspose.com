[Aspose.BarCode for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/barcode/net) doesn't just create or recognize barcodes but it provides a complete framework to control almost everything about barcodes. Developers can customize the barcode's appearance like bar height, colors, margins, borders, row/columns count and interpolation modes, as well as barcode generation properties like symbol mode encodings, error correction modes, ECI modes or special barcode metadata. While scanning for barcodes, developers can specify the area/areas where a barcode can be found. Moreover, scanning engine can be optimized for better barcode reading quality or speed with variety of options, which allows to recognize strongly corrupted barcodes.

## **General Features**
- Barcode generation
- Barcode recognition
- Symbology specification (80+ symbologies: 1D, 2D, DataBar, Postal, HIBC, GS1 types)
- Managing barcode appearance-related parameters
- Image rotation
- Encoding and decoding non-English characters in 2D types
- Customizing recognition engine variables
- Saving to or loading from a stream or a file
- Label printing
- Working with complex barcodes (e.g. Swiss QR Code) 

## **Barcode Recognition Features**
- Class [*BarCodeReader*](https://reference.aspose.com/barcode/net/aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition/barcodereader): reading 1D and 2D barcodes at any angle from an image

- Managing recognition engine variables to reach the best trade-off between reading speed and quality (both manually and through embedded presets). For example, the following cases can be allowed for recognition: color barcodes on color background, dashed industrial Datamatrix barcodes, decreased images, damaged barcodes with incorrect text, damaged QR Codes, and others
- Detecting and then reading all barcodes presented in the scanned region
- Reading barcodes of different 1D types from a single scanned region
- Defining the angle and region information for all barcodes recognized in an image (using points, quadrangle, or rectangle to specify a bounding barcode region)
- Performing checksum validation for 1D and postal barcodes
- Increasing the barcode detection speed through multi-threading
- Scanning from multi-page TIFF through System.Drawing
- Scanning from PDF format via [*Aspose.PDF*](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/)

- Saving barcode labels in various image formats: JPEG, TIFF, PNG, BMP, GIF, EMF, and SVG 
- Customizing the barcode encoding type and parameters
- Supporting checksum addition (for 1D barcodes) and supplement data
- Supporting X- and Y-dimensions for 2D barcodes
- Customizing a wide-to-narrow ratio for the supported symbologies to improve recognition precision

- Auto-sizing of barcode images
- Rendering barcode images on any device

## Supported Symbologies for Barcode Generation & Recognition

**Linear barcode types**, or *1D barcodes*, correspond to the first generation of one-dimensional barcodes (1D) that are used to represent information by varying the widths and spacings of parallel lines. Some 1D symbologies allow encoding only numbers, while others permit encoding also letters.  

**DataBar barcodes** (former RSS-14) are 1D and 1D staked barcodes, which were developed to efficiently encode [*GS1 Application Identifier*](https://ref.gs1.org/ai/?lang=en) data.

**Matrix barcodes**, also known as *2D barcodes*, have been introduced as a two-dimensional way to encode information. Two-dimensional (2D) barcodes are generated using various symbols and shapes. This barcode type is considered to be more efficient, as such barcodes contain more data per unit area, and most of them are self-correctable.  
  
**Postal barcodes** are specific symbologies used by postal services in different countries.

**HIBC barcodes** encode data in [special format](https://www.hibcc.org/udi-labeling-standards/barcode-standards/) which is used in Health Industry. As transport, the barcodes use other 1D and 2D barcodes and encode data as Alpha-Numeric.

**GS1 barcodes** use other 1D and 2D barcodes to encode [*GS1 Application Identifier*](https://ref.gs1.org/ai/?lang=en) data.

**Note on 32-bit (x86) Environments**

Aspose.BarCode fully supports 32-bit (x86) applications. However, it is recommended to use a 64-bit (x64) environment when possible.

Due to the inherent memory limitations of 32-bit processes, barcode recognition performance may be reduced in scenarios that require significant computational or memory resources, including:
* processing large or high-resolution images,
* PDF and document-based workflows,
* batch or bulk recognition operations,
* multi-threaded or server-side applications.

For improved performance, stability, and scalability, use of a 64-bit environment is advised.

## Get Started

Are you ready to give Aspose.BarCode for .NET a try? Simply add Aspose.BarCode to your project references as Nuget package. If you have some difficulties with this, [our examples](https://github.com/aspose-barcode/Aspose.BarCode-for-.NET/blob/master/Examples/CSharp/CSharp.csproj) help you to manage with this.

## Generate a Barcode Label with Code128

Try the following snippet to see how Aspose.BarCode API performs in your environment or check the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aspose-barcode/Aspose.BarCode-for-.NET) for other common usage scenarios.

```csharp
// instantiate object and set different barcode properties
BarcodeGenerator generator = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.Code128, "1234567");
generator.Parameters.Barcode.XDimension.Millimeters = 1f;

// save the image to your system and set its image format to Png
generator.Save(dir + "output.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```

## Hide Barcode Text from the PNG Label via C# Code

Aspose.BarCode for .NET allows you to customize various properties of barcodes, such as borders, color, type, bar height as well as barcode text. The following example shows, how simple it is to hide the barcode text using C#.

```csharp
string codeText = "This text is hidden.\n" + "This text is hidden.\n";;

// instantiate barcode object and set CodeText, Symbology , and  CodeLocation
BarcodeGenerator generator = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.DataMatrix, codeText);
generator.Parameters.Barcode.CodeTextParameters.Location = CodeLocation.None;
generator.Save(dir + "output.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```

## Recognize Barcode from File via C# Code

The following example demonstrates how to scan a picture of a barcode image using Aspose.BarCode
```csharp
// Read file from directory with DecodeType.EAN13
using (BarCodeReader reader = new BarCodeReader(dataDir + "Scan.jpg", DecodeType.EAN13))
{
    foreach (BarCodeResult result in reader.ReadBarCodes())
    {
        // Read symbology type and code text
        Console.WriteLine("Symbology Type: " + result.CodeType);
        Console.WriteLine("CodeText: " + result.CodeText);
    }
}
```
