#### Release Highlights

Aspose.BarCode for .NET 24.12 delivers a significant boost in recognition performance and reliability. The release introduces an experimental vector-based PDF encoder, improves recognition quality across 1D barcode families, and addresses multiple stability issues in USPS OneCode, SwissQR, and AutoSizeMode rendering.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **PDF Encoder (Experimental)**: Generate vector-format barcodes directly into `.pdf` files for seamless print and archive workflows.
- **QualitySettings Extended**: Recognition optimizations for NBase and WBase barcode processors enhance speed and accuracy.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Enhanced NBase Barcode Engines**: Improved recognition performance for Code128, GS1Code128, SCC14, EAN14, SSCC18, SwissPostParcel, HIBC, ITF14, and more.
- **Improved WBase Symbologies**: Optimized scanning for Code11, Code39, Codabar, PZN, MSI, DeutschePost, VIN, and additional 1D standards.

### üõ† Fix

- **USPS OneCode Recognition**: Fixed incorrect decoding for barcodes starting with `00`.
- **45-Degree Rotation Exception**: Resolved barcode generation failure when using `AutoSizeMode.Nearest` and `RotationAngle = 45`.
- **QuadPointsHelper Crash**: Eliminated infinite recursion in internal geometry helper.
- **SwissQR Exception Messaging**: More descriptive error messages added for missing mandatory address fields.
- **ComplexBarcode.Address Field Initialization**: Resolved `null` reference error during structured barcode generation.
