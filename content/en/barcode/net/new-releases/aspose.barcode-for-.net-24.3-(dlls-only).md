### Barcode Recognition Improvements

The .NET barcode API now provides better QR code recognition for QR codes having rounded targets, darkened/lightened right or bottom sides, and Pdf417 barcodes.

### Updated Aztec Barcode Engine

This release delivers a new `QualitySettings` structure providing more control to C# developers over Aztec barcode generation.

### Updates to The Public API

We have added `XmlSerializationAttribute` and `XmlSerializationType` API members to the public API to help enhance code serialization.

### Bug Fixes

Several problems have been resolved in the latest .NET API release addressing reported problems with QR code and Pdf417 recognition.
