- **Advanced Quality Settings**: Improved internal handling of recognition for complex 1D barcode sets.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Faster NBase/WBase Recognition**: Speed and accuracy optimizations for over 20 1D symbologies including Code128, GS1, Codabar, HIBC, ITF14, and more.

### üõ† Fix

- **USPS OneCode Start Code Issue**: Corrected misread issue for codes beginning with `00`.
- **AutoSizeMode Nearest Crash Fix**: Generator now successfully renders rotated barcodes.
- **SwissQR NullReference Fix**: More reliable initialization of `ComplexBarcode.Address` fields.
- **Elliptical Recursion in Rendering**: QuadPointsHelper now safely exits invalid geometry paths.
