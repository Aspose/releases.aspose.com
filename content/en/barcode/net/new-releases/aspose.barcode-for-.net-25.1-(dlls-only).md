#### Release Highlights

Aspose.BarCode for .NET 25.1 DLLs-only package introduces improved recognition for key 1D symbologies and extends encoding customization with BOM control. Developers gain deeper API control and more reliable recognition outcomes under concurrent execution.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Byte Order Mark Encoding**: Developers can now toggle BOM in `SetCodeText()` for ASCII, UTF8, and ISO/IEC encodings directly.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Optimized NDTBase Engine**: Performance upgrades for Code128, Code16K, Code39, and UPCE recognition.
- **Uniform Image Output**: Different generation methods now yield consistent visual output.

### üõ† Fix

- **Multithreaded Detection Fix**: Stabilized barcode detection under simultaneous recognition processes.
- **Sorting Crash Resolved**: `LikelihoodPairComparer` sorting logic corrected to prevent recognition exceptions.
