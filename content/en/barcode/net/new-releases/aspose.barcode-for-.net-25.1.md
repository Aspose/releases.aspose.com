#### Release Highlights

Aspose.BarCode for .NET 25.1 brings enhanced stability and precision to barcode generation and recognition. The update includes recognition performance improvements for NDTBase-based symbologies, refined image consistency, and newly overloaded `SetCodeText` APIs to explicitly manage encoding behavior with or without BOM (Byte Order Mark).

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Enhanced Encoding Control**: New overloads in `SetCodeText` allow fine-tuned BOM usage for barcode codetext in 1D and 2D symbologies.

### üîß Enhancement

- **NDTBase Recognition Upgrade**: Improved recognition speed and accuracy for Code128, Code16K, UPCE, Supplement, Code39, and Code39FullASCII.
- **Image Consistency Refinement**: Generating the same barcode image via multiple methods now produces uniform results.

### üõ† Fix

- **Thread Safety Fix**: Multi-threaded recognition engine enhanced for barcode region detection consistency.
- **Sorting Algorithm Bug**: Corrected logic in `LikelihoodPairComparer` to prevent misdetection issues during QR recognition.
