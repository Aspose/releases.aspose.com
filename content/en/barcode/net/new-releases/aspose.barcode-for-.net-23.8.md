Try the following snippet to see how Aspose.BarCode API performs in your environment or check the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aspose-barcode/Aspose.BarCode-for-.NET) for other common usage scenarios.

```csharp
// instantiate object and set different barcode properties
BarcodeGenerator generator = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.Code128, "1234567");
generator.Parameters.Barcode.XDimension.Millimeters = 1 f;

// save the image to your system and set its image format to Jpeg
generator.Save(dir + "output.jpg", BarCodeImageFormat.Jpeg);
```

## Hide Barcode Text from the PNG Label via C# Code

Aspose.BarCode for .NET allows you to customize various properties of barcodes, such as borders, color, type, bar height as well as barcode text. The following example shows, how simple it is to hide the barcode text using C#.

```csharp
string codeText = "This text is hidden.\n" + "This text is hidden.\n";;

// instantiate barcode object and set CodeText, Symbology , and  CodeLocation
BarcodeGenerator generator = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.DataMatrix, codeText);
generator.Parameters.Barcode.CodeTextParameters.Location = CodeLocation.None;
generator.Save(dir + "output.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```
