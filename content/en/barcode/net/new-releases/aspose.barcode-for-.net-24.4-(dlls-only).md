We are glad to announce Aspose.BarCode for .NET 24.4 release. The DLLs-only package for the latest version of the .NET API offers optimized QR code processing, DataMatrix generation, and bug fixes to improve overall barcode accuracy.

### Improved QR Code Recognition

You can now work with improved detection of Unicode characters within QR codes for broader compatibility.

### Quality Control of `DataMatrix` 

Using the newly added `QualitySettings` structure in the most recent update to the C# barcode API, .NET developers can empower your apps with enhanced `DataMatrix` barcode generation quality.

### Accurate `DotCode` Barcodes

Aspose.BarCode for .NET 24.4 includes fixes for Reed-Solomon error encoding and size calculations ensuring accurate `DotCode` barcodes.

### Bug Squashing

We have resolved multiple issues with `Standard2of5`, `IATA2of5`, QR code recognition, and unexpected `DecodeType` detection in this API release.
