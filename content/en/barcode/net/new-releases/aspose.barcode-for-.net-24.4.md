We are glad to announce the new release of Aspose.BarCode for .NET. The MSI installer for version 24.4 of the .NET API offers enhanced QR code processing, DataMatrix generation, and bug fixes to improve overall barcode accuracy.

### Enhanced QR Code Recognition

.NET developers can now experience improved detection of Unicode characters within QR codes for broader compatibility.

### `DataMatrix` Quality Control

Using the newly added `QualitySettings` structure in the latest update to the C# barcode API, you can empower your apps with fine-tuned `DataMatrix` barcode generation quality.

### `DotCode` Accuracy Boost

We have added fixes for Reed-Solomon error encoding and size calculations that ensure accurate `DotCode` barcodes.

### Bug Squashing

Aspose.BarCode for .NET 24.4 resolves multiple issues with `Standard2of5`, `IATA2of5`, QR code recognition, and unexpected `DecodeType` detection.
