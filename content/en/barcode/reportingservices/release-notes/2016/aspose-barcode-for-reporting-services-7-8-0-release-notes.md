The list of changes applicable to the Reporting services are as follows:
###### **Namespaces have been updated**
Public Namespaces have been re-arranged according to [Microsoft guidelines.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229026%28v=vs.110%29.aspx)

The namespace Aspose.BarCodeRecognition has been replaced with Aspose.BarCode.BarCodeRecognition; BarCode.Common has been replaces with Aspose.BarCode.Common.
