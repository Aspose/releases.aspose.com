### HanXin Recognition Boost

Experience improved accuracy when processing HanXin barcodes with the advanced recognition algorithms of Aspose.BarCode for Android via Java 24.6.

### Refined CODABAR Reading

The Android barcode API v24.6 gives you access to detailed information about CODABAR barcodes, including start and stop symbols, for more robust parsing.

### Flexible 2D Barcode Encoding

Developers can leverage new encoding modes for Aztec, Data Matrix, DotCode, PDF417, and MaxiCode barcodes and enable precise control over data representation.

### Removed and Deprecated APIs

We have removed APIs related to code text encoding as they are replaced by the new `setCodeText` method with encoding options in this Android library version. Additionally, several encoding-related methods and fields are marked as deprecated for future removal.
