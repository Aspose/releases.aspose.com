### Improved QR Barcode Recognition

Aspose.BarCode for Python via Java 24.5 enhances the detection of Unicode characters within QR codes for accurate data extraction.

### `DataMatrix` Quality Control

This release of the Python barcode API brings the new `QualitySettings` structure, which empowers you to fine-tune the quality of generated `DataMatrix` barcodes.

### `DotCode` Accuracy Boost

Python developers can now utilize precise Reed-Solomon error encoding to ensure reliable information encoding within `DotCode` barcodes.

### Accurate `DotCode` Size Generation

We have fixed the issues causing incorrect sizing during `DotCode` barcode generation.

### `DecodeType` Clarification

With the latest Python library release, `BarCodeReader` now accurately identifies the used `DecodeType` for clear processing insights.

### Unspecified Barcode Handling

Another important update in this version is the improved detection logic for handling barcodes of unknown types.

### Public API Streamlining

We have streamlined the public API by removing deprecated constructors and methods for a cleaner and more efficient user experience.
