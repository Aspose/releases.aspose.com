#### Release Highlights

Aspose.BarCode for C++ 24.12 for Windows introduces an experimental PDF encoder and enhanced barcode recognition through QualitySettings for 1D symbologies. Critical fixes address USPS OneCode decoding, SwissQR exceptions, and AutoSizeMode behavior with rotated barcodes.

#### New Features and Enhancements

- **New PDF Encoder (Experimental)**:
  - Save generated barcodes in vector-based PDF format using `BarCodeImageFormat::Pdf`.

- **Recognition Enhancements**:
  - QualitySettings support added to NBase and WBase processors for symbologies including Code128, Codabar, Interleaved2of5, and many others.
  - Improved recognition quality and speed for over 30 barcode types.

#### Fixes

- **USPS OneCode Issue Fixed**:
  - Correctly recognizes codes starting with "00".

- **Rotation Bug in AutoSizeMode**:
  - Fixed rendering issue when generating barcodes at 45Â° rotation with `AutoSizeMode::Nearest`.

- **SwissQR Exception Clarity**:
  - Improved exception messages during generation when required fields (e.g., country code) are missing.

- **Address Field Initialization Bug**:
  - Resolved improper initialization in `ComplexBarcode.Address`.
