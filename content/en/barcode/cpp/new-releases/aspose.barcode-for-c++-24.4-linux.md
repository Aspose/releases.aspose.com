### Unicode Character Detection Accuracy for QR Codes

Aspose.BarCode for C++ 24.4 provides accurate handling and processing of QR codes containing various Unicode character sets on the Linux platform. 

### Control `DataMatrix` Barcode Quality on Linux

Optimize `DataMatrix` barcode generation using the new `QualitySettings` structure introduced in the latest C++ barcode API version. It provides developers with finer control over the quality of generated barcodes.

### Enhanced `DotCode` Barcode Rendering

The issues related to the size and Reed-Solomon error encoding of barcodes have been fixed for reliable `DotCode` barcode generation in this C++ API version on Linux. 

### Barcode Reader Compatibility

Aspose.BarCode for C++ 24.4 includes improved barcode recognition across .NET Core environments as various relevant problems have been resolved.

### Standard 2 of 5 and IATA 2 of 5 Encoding Precision

In this API release, we have fixed the wide bar width discrepancies in the start and stop patterns for these barcode formats on Linux.
