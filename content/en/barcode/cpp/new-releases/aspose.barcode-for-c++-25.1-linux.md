#### Release Highlights

Aspose.BarCode for C++ 25.1 for Linux brings enhanced barcode decoding with updated NDTBase processors and full support for charset-based codetext encoding. This update ensures accurate results and robust behavior in multi-threaded barcode scanning systems.

#### New Features and Enhancements

- **Improved Recognition Quality**:
  - Targeted enhancements for Code128, Code39, UPCE, and other 1D formats using the NDTBase processor.

- **Flexible Encoding API**:
  - Use `SetCodeText()` to encode codetext with or without BOM in UTF-8, ASCII, and ISO encodings.

- **Concurrency Improvements**:
  - Better recognition stability in Linux multi-core environments.

#### Fixes

- **Image Output Consistency Fix**:
  - Unified results from different barcode generation flows via refined internal sorting.
