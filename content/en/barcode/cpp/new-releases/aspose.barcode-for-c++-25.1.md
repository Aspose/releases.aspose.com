#### Release Highlights

Aspose.BarCode for C++ 25.1 for Windows introduces advanced recognition capabilities and encoding flexibility. The update significantly enhances decoding accuracy and performance of key symbologies and adds charset-based codetext encoding with optional BOM control.

#### New Features and Enhancements

- **NDTBase Recognition Optimization**:
  - Enhanced speed and quality for Code128, Code39, Code16K, Supplement, UPCE, and Code39FullASCII.

- **Charset Encoding with BOM Support**:
  - `SetCodeText()` now supports encoding selection with/without byte order mark (BOM) for ASCII, ISO/IEC 8859-1, and UTF-8.

- **Multithreading Stability**:
  - Improved recognition consistency in concurrent environments.

#### Fixes

- **LikelihoodPairComparer Sorting Fix**:
  - Enhanced result sorting logic ensures consistent image decoding across generation paths.
