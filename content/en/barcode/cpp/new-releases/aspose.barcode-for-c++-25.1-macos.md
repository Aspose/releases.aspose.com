#### Release Highlights

Aspose.BarCode for C++ 25.1 for macOS delivers improved decoding for high-speed scanning and adds precise charset-based text encoding support. With BOM handling and multithread-safe upgrades, developers gain fine control over barcode input and output behavior.

#### New Features and Enhancements

- **Enhanced Barcode Engine**:
  - Optimized NDTBase decoding for key formats including Code128, Code16K, and Supplement barcodes.

- **New BOM-Enabled Encoding Options**:
  - Easily specify whether to include BOM in encoded text using `SetCodeText()` overloads.

- **Threading and Recognition Stability**:
  - Greater consistency in concurrent decoding workflows.

#### Fixes

- **Improved Sorting Logic**:
  - `LikelihoodPairComparer` updated to ensure decoding consistency across image generation methods.
