Aspose.BarCode for C++ enables the developers to generate, scan, and manipulate barcodes from within their own C++ applications. C++ Barcode Library allows you to modify and customize barcode properties including font, foreground & background colors, alignment, barcode label location, and barcode caption.

## Why download Aspose.BarCode for C++?

Aspose.BarCode for C++ is an on premise API to add the functionality of barcode scanning, recognition, generation, and conversion to your existing or new C++ applications. Aspose.BarCode has the capability to work with 40+ different barcode symbologies without requiring any 3rd party software installation. Aspose.BarCode for C++ supports barcodes of various file formats such as, JPEG, SVG, PNG, EMF, EXIF, etc. Along with generating high-quality numeric, alpha-numeric and 2D barcodes, you can also customize and control the appearance of the generated barcodes; such as, CodeText, captions, dimensions, aspect ratio, and more. Apply checksum validation on specific symbologies.

It also assists you in scanning, reading and recognizing barcodes in an efficient manner via multi-threading. It can recognize barcode symbologies and fetch the CodeText. You can also detect multiple symbologies present in a single picture or perform barcode recognition on a page with mixed text and images.

Aspose.BarCode for C++ is completely written in C++ and exposes a simple set of C++ classes that allow you to create barcodes at the backend, while also providing GUI based controls to display barcodes in Windows Forms and Web Forms.
