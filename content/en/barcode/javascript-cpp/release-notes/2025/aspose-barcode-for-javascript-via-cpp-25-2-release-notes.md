## Public API changes and backwards compatibility
### Recognition Quality and Speed of NDTBase Processors
The recognition quality and speed of ***NDTBase*** processors have been enhanced. These improvements apply to the following symbologies:  
- Code128  
- Code16K  
- Supplement  
- UPCE  
- Code39  
- Code39FullASCII

### Recognition Quality Stability
Fixes were applied to the barcode area detector, enhancing barcode recognition stability in multi-threaded environments.

### Recognition Quality and Speed of 1D Processors
The recognition quality and speed of ***PBase*** processors have been improved. These updates apply to the following symbologies:  
- PatchCode  
- Pharmacode  

Additionally, the recognition speed of most 1D processors has been enhanced with updates to the 1D recognition engine.

### PDF Encoder
A bug was fixed that caused differences in generated PDF files depending on system localization.
