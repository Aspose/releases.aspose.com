## **Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes**

The following is a list of any changes made to the public API such as added, renamed, removed or deprecated members as well as any non-backward compatible change made to Aspose.Cells for Java. If you have concerns about any change listed, please raise it on the Aspose.Cells support forum.

### **Changes behavior of Cells.DeleteBlankRows() method**

In old versions, we did not take a row as blank if it intersects some merged cells so it will not be deleted. From 23.6, if one row intersects some merged cells only and has no cell data or other related objects, it will be taken as blank and will be deleted.

### **Changes behavior of constructing save options with mismatched save format**

For constructing specific save options with save format, sometimes user may provide unmatched format as the parameter. In old version the unmatched format may be accepted directly, this may cause ambiguities and even unexpected result. From 23.6, we reset the unmatched save format to a default one which matches the specific save options. Those influenced save options and default format are: OoxmlSaveOptions-xlsx, HtmlSaveOptions-html, OdsSaveOptions-ods, XlsSaveOptions-xls.

### **Adds RowCollection.iterator(bool reversed, bool sync) method**

Provides user the ability of traversing Row objects in the collection in reversed order.

### **Obsoletes XlsSaveOptions.IsTemplate method**

For template file, please create save options by XlsSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Xlt). Otherwise create it by XlsSaveOptions().

### **Adds ListColumn.GetDataStyle() and ListColumn.GetDataStyle() methods.**

Gets and sets the style of the column in the table.

### **Adds ListObject.PutCellFormula(int,int,string,bool) method.**

Sets the formula to table.

### **Adds RevisionLogCollection.HighlightChanges() method and HighlightChangesOptions class.**

Exports and highlights all revision logs to a new worksheet.

### **Adds FileFormatType.GZip enum.**

It's used to detect whether the file is GZip file.
