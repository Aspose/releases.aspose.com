- **PDF Rendering:**
  - Enhanced fidelity in graph exports, particularly for label positioning, graph appearance, and rounded rectangle shapes.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

  - `Range.isBlank()`  
    - Checks if a range is entirely empty.

  - `Range.addHyperlink(String text, String address, String tooltip)`  
    - Adds hyperlinks directly to ranges.
