# What's new in the Aspose.Cells for Java 23.6

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Cells for Java 23.6 introduces powerful revision tracking features, including the ability to highlight tracked changes and export them to PDF. It also adds support for SVG image optimization, duotone visual effects, and automatic GZip format detection. Several Excel-to-HTML and pivot-related bugs have been fixed for better rendering fidelity and data accuracy.

## Enhancements

- **Track Changes Export**
  - Export tracked changes to PDF and highlight them visually using `RevisionLogCollection.HighlightChanges()`.

- **SVG Optimization**
  - Optimized SVG output reduces file size without compromising on quality.

- **Duotone Effects**
  - Support added for reading and writing duotone visual effects in Excel files.

- **GZip Format Detection**
  - The API now detects and supports GZip file format via `FileFormatType.GZip`.

## Bug Fixes

- **Pivot Table Copying**
  - Fixed issue where pivot tables were not copied correctly between worksheets.

- **Formula Calculation**
  - FILTER function and subtotal sorting results are now accurate.

- **Rendering Improvements**
  - Corrected chart axis labels, image alignments, threaded comment rendering, and HTML output fidelity.

- **Workbook Merging**
  - Image color retention improved when merging workbooks.

- **Exceptions Resolved**
  - Addressed OutOfMemory, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, and pivot data field removal errors.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Additions:**
  - `RowCollection.iterator(bool reversed, bool sync)`
  - `ListColumn.GetDataStyle()`, `SetDataStyle(Style)`
  - `ListObject.PutCellFormula(int, int, string, bool)`
  - `RevisionLogCollection.HighlightChanges()`, `HighlightChangesOptions`
  - `FileFormatType.GZip`

- **Behavior Changes:**
  - `Cells.DeleteBlankRows()` now considers intersecting merged rows as blank if no content exists.
  - Strict format checking enforced for `SaveOptions` constructors.

- **Deprecated:**
  - `XlsSaveOptions.IsTemplate` – replaced with `XlsSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Xlt)`
