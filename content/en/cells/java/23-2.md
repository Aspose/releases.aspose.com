# What's new in the Aspose.Cells for Java 23.2

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Cells for Java 23.2 introduces key improvements in Excel-to-HTML rendering, particularly for rotated shapes, merged areas, and text alignment. This release also expands JSON export capabilities with `toJson()` methods for `Style` and `Cell`, and unifies JSON layout options.

## Enhancements

- **XLSX Metadata**
  - The `<Application>` tag in XLSX now gets correctly filled to improve file interoperability.

- **Excel 95 Compatibility**
  - Improved support for `FillType`, horizontal flipping of arrow lines, and pattern fills in Excel 5.0/95 formats.

## Bug Fixes

- **HTML Export Issues**
  - Resolved layout problems like image stretching, arrow displacement, and merged cell data loss.
  - Fixed missing text in last columns, and formatting inconsistencies in exported HTML.
  - Corrected shape rotation and font conversion problems in XLS to HTML.

- **PDF Conversion Fixes**
  - Fixed incorrect chart rendering, scattered diagram placement, and title border issues.
  - Addressed font rendering problems and cell formatting errors in Excel-to-PDF.

- **Chart and Cell Errors**
  - Fixed chart-to-image conversion exceptions.
  - Corrected `SUM` and `AVERAGE` calculations resulting in `#VALUE!`.
  - Global named ranges and number formats now maintain integrity post conversion.

- **OneDrive and Excel Behavior**
  - Prevented re-saved XLS files from reporting issues on cloud platforms.
  - Corrected cell formatting errors after using `deleteRows`.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Added:**
  - `ChartTextFrame.isAutomaticRotation`: Determines if chart text rotates automatically.
  - `Style.toJson()` and `Cell.toJson()`: Convert formatting and data directly into JSON format.
  - `JsonLayoutOptions.IgnoreTitle`: Unified replacement for deprecated `IgnoreObjectTitle` and `IgnoreArrayTitle`.
