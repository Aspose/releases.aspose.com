  A new `ChartCalculateOptions` class and `Chart.calculate(ChartCalculateOptions)` method provide granular control over auto-layout of chart elements like axes and plot areas.

- **Hidden Column Width Detection:**  
  The `Cells.getColumnWidthPixel(int, boolean)` method now accurately retrieves the pixel width of hidden columns.

## Enhancements

- **Column Width Accuracy:**
  - Improved width calculations for hidden columns, which previously returned incorrect pixel widths.
