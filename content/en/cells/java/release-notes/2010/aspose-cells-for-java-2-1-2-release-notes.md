Notable changes for users: 



In old versions, Cell.getStyle()/Row.getStyle()/Column.getStyle() methods might cause Cell/Row/Column maintain their own Style object. Modification of the returned Style object for getStyle() later will change the Cell/Row/Column's style directly. 

From this version, all Style objects that set to Cell/Row/Column will be gathered for performance considerations and Cell/Row/Column will only maintain a style reference. Modification of the returned Style object for getStyle() later will not change the Cell/Row/Column's style. To make the modification take effect, users need to call setStyle() for Cell/Row/Column after the style is modified. 

This rule is required for Style.getFont()/getColor()/getPatternColor()/getBorderColor() methods too. In old versions, modification of the returned Font/Color object might cause the style change directly. In the new version, after making changes for the Font/Color object, users need to call Style.setFont()/setColor()/setPatternColor()/setBorderColor() to make the modification take effect.
