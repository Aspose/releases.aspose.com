# What's new in Aspose.Cells for Java 24.5

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Cells for Java 24.5 introduces new functionality for exporting form controls in HTML, accessing original row height, and defining measurement units for size-related methods. This release also includes updates to formula behavior, rendering precision, and HTML export fidelity, alongside key API refinements.

## New Features

- **Export Form Controls to HTML:**  
  Forms can now be rendered as HTML controls during export, improving usability and visual fidelity in browser-based viewers.

- **Access Original Row Height in Pixels:**  
  Developers can retrieve the original pixel height of hidden rows for layout inspection and styling.

- **New Unit-Based Measurement API:**  
  Introduced `CellsUnitType` enum and methods for retrieving column width and row height in various units (points, pixels, inches).

- **Advanced Filtering Support:**  
  A new `AdvancedFilter` class and `Worksheet.getAdvancedFilter()` method allow inspection of advanced filter settings.

## Enhancements

- **Updated File Extension for Tab-Delimited Files:**  
  `LoadFormat.TabDelimited` now correctly maps to the `.tsv` extension instead of the generic `.txt`.

- **Range API Improvements:**
  - `Range.unionRanges()` replaces the deprecated `unionRang()` for more intuitive range merging.
  - New `Range.transpose()` method enables row-to-column transposition.

- **HTML Export Enhancements:**
  - `HtmlSaveOptions.addGenericFont` ensures fallback font families are included in HTML exports.
  - `HtmlSaveOptions.isBorderCollapsed` controls CSS table border behavior.

- **Style Settings Control:**
  - `DefaultStyleSettings.builtInPreference` allows prioritizing built-in formats vs custom patterns in styling.

## Bug Fixes

- **Rendering Issues:**
  - Fixed misalignment of tick marks in chart X-axis rendering.
  - Restored missing trendline equations in PDF-exported charts.
  - Adjusted gridline thickness during image rendering.

- **Formula and Data Accuracy:**
  - Corrected `WORKDAY` formula issues when referencing holiday cells.
  - Fixed exceptions from `TEXTBEFORE` and `TEXTAFTER` during formula calculations.

- **Embedded Objects and Font Issues:**
  - Resolved partial visibility of embedded Word objects in PDF output.
  - Fixed incorrect font-family extraction in HTML output.

- **Text and Layout Fixes:**
  - Addressed text offsetting issues and HTML rendering anomalies (rotated text, cross-column text failures, cell data shifts).

## Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes

**New Classes and Enums:**
- `AdvancedFilter`
- `CellsUnitType`: Unit specification for height and width methods.

**New Methods and Properties:**
- `Worksheet.getAdvancedFilter(int, boolean, CellsUnitType)`
- `Cells.getRowHeight(int, boolean, CellsUnitType)`
- `Cells.getColumnWidth(int, boolean, CellsUnitType)`
- `Range.unionRanges()`, `Range.transpose()`
- `HtmlSaveOptions.addGenericFont`, `isBorderCollapsed`
- `WorkbookSettings.defaultStyleSettings`, `DefaultStyleSettings.builtInPreference`

**Obsolete Methods:**
- `Cells.getColumnOriginalWidthPoint(int)`
- `Cells.getColumnWidthPixel(int, boolean)`
- `Cells.getColumnWidthInch(int)`
- `Cells.getRowOriginalHeightPoint()`
- `Range.unionRang()`
