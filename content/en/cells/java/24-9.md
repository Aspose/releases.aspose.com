# What's new in Aspose.Cells for Java 24.9

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Cells for Java 24.9 expands PivotTable interactivity, boosts smart marker support for JSON and complex data types, and improves formula compatibility. This update also resolves critical issues related to HTML rendering, XLSB conversion, and formula processing, while refining the public API for consistency and clarity.

## New Features

- **Display PivotTable Field Details:**  
  The new `PivotTable.showDetail()` method allows users to drill into the detail of value fields, replicating Excel’s native “Show Details” action.

- **Cell Checkbox Styling Support:**  
  New property `Cell.isCheckBoxStyle` allows setting a cell to visually behave like a checkbox, enhancing UI/UX in data capture scenarios.

- **Print Comments Including Threaded Comments:**  
  Added `PrintCommentsType.printWithThreadedComments` to control printing of inline and threaded comments.

- **Equation and Math Enhancements:**
  - `LimLowUppEquationNode` for limit notation.
  - `ArrayEquationNode` supports arrays of equations.
  - `HtmlSaveOptions.officeMathOutputMode` controls OfficeMath HTML rendering.

## Enhancements

- **Improved Smart Marker Processing for JSON:**
  - Support for skipping unmatched smart marker tags in JSON.
  - Data source compatibility extended to include maps, arrays, base64 image data, UTC date strings, and repeated formulas.

- **Performance Fixes:**
  - Improved speed of `Cells.clearContents` method that had regressed in version 24.6.

- **Pivot Enhancements:**
  - `PivotField.getFormula()` replaces the older `getCalculatedFieldFormula()`.
  - `PivotItem.getFormula()` and `PivotItem.name` enhance access to calculated items and naming.
  - Fixes pivot cache truncation and corrupted pivot field naming with special characters.

## Bug Fixes

- **Formula Issues:**
  - Corrected inconsistencies in `TEXTJOIN()` results.
  - Fixed smart marker formula processing and date-time conversions using JSON sources.

- **Rendering & Conversion Bugs:**
  - Restored line visibility in Excel-to-HTML conversions.
  - Fixed image rendering when using `Cell.setHtmlString()` with external URLs.
  - Prevented space removal from text during HTML string set.
  - Restored named ranges lost during XLSX to XLSB conversion.
  - Corrected pivot field name issue causing XLSB to XLSM corruption.

- **Smart Marker & JSON Integration:**
  - Fixed `NullPointerException` for missing smart marker tags.
  - Ensured smooth import of base64 pictures, arrays, and complex map structures.

## Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes

**New Properties and Methods:**
- `Cell.isCheckBoxStyle`
- `PivotField.getFormula()`
- `PivotItem.getFormula()`, `.name`
- `PivotTable.showDetail()`
- `HtmlSaveOptions.officeMathOutputMode`, `cellNameAttribute`
- `XlsSaveOptions.wpsCompatibility`
- `PrintCommentsType.printWithThreadedComments`

**New Enums and Classes:**
- `FileFormatType.Ole`
- `LimLowUppEquationNode`
- `ArrayEquationNode`
- `HtmlOfficeMathOutputType`

**Renamed/Obsoleted:**
- Renamed members of `EquationNodeType` to use shorter names
- Deprecated: `PivotField.getCalculatedFieldFormula()`
