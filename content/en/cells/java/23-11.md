# What's new in the Aspose.Cells for Java 23.11

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Cells for Java 23.11 introduces robust enhancements for pivot table grouping, refined HTML export accuracy, and support for PDF versions 1.4 through 1.7. This release also addresses formula evaluation accuracy, rendering performance, and cell overflow handling, improving overall Excel-to-HTML and PDF fidelity.

## New Features

- **PDF Version Targeting:**
  - Added support for rendering Excel to PDF with compatibility for PDF 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7 via `PdfCompliance` enum.

- **Default Font Color Constant:**
  - Introduced a static final `Color` representing Excel's default font color.

## Enhancements

- **HTML Export:**
  - New `HtmlSaveOptions.calculateFormula` lets users enable/disable formula recalculation before saving HTML.
  - New `HtmlSaveOptions.formatDataIgnoreColumnWidth` to avoid content clipping when column width is narrow.
  - Improved date formatting, merged cell rendering, and border fidelity.

- **Pivot Table Grouping Improvements:**
  - Added `PivotField.groupBy()` methods for date/time and numeric grouping.
  - Introduced `PivotFieldGroupSettings`, `PivotNumbericRangeGroupSettings`, and `PivotDateTimeRangeGroupSettings`.
  - Added `PivotField.ungroup()` replacing the old `PivotTable.setUngroup()`.

## Bug Fixes

- **Calculation Accuracy:**
  - Fixed errors in `DAYS360` and `LOOKUP` functions, particularly in regional (e.g., Chinese) environments.
  - Resolved crash and result corruption issues during formula calculation and pivot refresh.

- **Rendering & Export:**
  - Fixed EMF+ rendering errors, slow PDF exports, and treemap chart crashes.
  - Corrected overflow tag rendering in HTML and restored borders, cell alignment, and merged structures.

- **Workbook and License Issues:**
  - Addressed `Workbook.isLicensed()` returning false after setting the license.
  - Fixed issues with `PivotTable.refresh()` disabling filters or freezing responsiveness.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New APIs:**
  - `HtmlSaveOptions.calculateFormula` and `formatDataIgnoreColumnWidth`
  - `CellsHelper.needQuoteInFormula(String)` for safe formula construction.
  - `PdfCompliance.Pdf15`, `Pdf16`, and `Pdf17` enums.
  - `ImageOrPrintOptions.emfRenderSetting` and `XpsSaveOptions.emfRenderSetting` for EMF image rendering control.
  - `Range.addHyperlink(String text, String address, String tooltip)` for hyperlink creation.

- **Pivot Table Refactoring:**
  - Replaced obsolete grouping methods like `PivotTable.setAutoGroupField()` with `PivotField.groupBy()`.
  - Deprecated `SxRng`, replaced with `PivotFieldGroupSettings`.
  - Introduced localized pivot field grouping labels with methods like `PivotGlobalizationSettings.getTextOfQuarters()`.
