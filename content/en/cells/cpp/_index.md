## Convert XLS to XLSX, XLSB & CSV using C++

Try executing the below snippet to see how API works in your environment or check the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aspose-cells/Aspose.Cells-for-C) for other common usage scenarios.

```c++
U16String dir(u"your path");
// load the file to be converted
Workbook book(dir + u"template.xls");
// save in different formats
book.Save(dir + u"output.xlsx", SaveFormat::Xlsx);
book.Save(dir + u"output.xlsb", SaveFormat::Xlsb);
book.Save(dir + u"output.csv", SaveFormat::CSV);
book.Save(dir + u"output.json", SaveFormat::Json);
```

## Create a Custom Excel Chart with C++

```c++
// create a new workbook
Workbook workbook;

// get first worksheet which is created by default
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.GetWorksheets().Get(0);

// add sample data
worksheet.GetCells().Get(u"A1").PutValue(50);
worksheet.GetCells().Get(u"A2").PutValue(100);
worksheet.GetCells().Get(u"A3").PutValue(150);
worksheet.GetCells().Get(u"A4").PutValue(110);
worksheet.GetCells().Get(u"B1").PutValue(260);
worksheet.GetCells().Get(u"B2").PutValue(12);
worksheet.GetCells().Get(u"B3").PutValue(50);
worksheet.GetCells().Get(u"B4").PutValue(100);

// add a chart to the worksheet
int chartIndex = worksheet.GetCharts().Add(Aspose::Cells::Charts::ChartType::Column, 5, 0, 20, 8);

// access the instance of the newly added chart
Chart chart = worksheet.GetCharts().Get(chartIndex);

// add SeriesCollection (chart data source) to the chart ranging from A1 to B4
chart.GetNSeries().Add(u"A1:B4", true);

// set the chart type of 2nd NSeries to display as line chart
chart.GetNSeries().Get(1).SetType(Aspose::Cells::Charts::ChartType::Line);

// save the Excel file
workbook.Save(u"output.xlsx");
```
