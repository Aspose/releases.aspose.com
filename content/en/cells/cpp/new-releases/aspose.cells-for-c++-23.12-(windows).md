### Concise & Modern Syntax

The new version of the C# spreadsheet API streamlines object initialization and interaction, making your code more readable and closer to standard C++ on Windows.

### Simplified Object Acquisition

Developers can seamlessly get objects from collections using the intuitive `Get(int)` method instead of the older `GetObjectByIndex(int)` using Aspose.Cells for C++ 23.12.

### Enhanced Interface Names

We have improved the naming scheme of interface names, which are slightly adjusted for better clarity (for example, `GetIWorksheets` becomes `GetWorksheets`).

### New String Interfaces

You can leverage new interfaces designed specifically for strings, like `Shape::AddHyperlink(const char16_t* address)`.

### Other Highlights

- **TIFF Images not Supported:** Aspose.Cells for C++ currently doesn't support generating TIFF images in this version. You can choose another format for image generation.
- **Changes to User-defined Forumulas:** User-defined formula functionality has undergone changes. The `ICustomFunction` base class is replaced with `AbstractCalculationEngine`, and its related functions are under development, so please use them cautiously.
