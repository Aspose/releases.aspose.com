#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Cells for C++ 24.12 (Windows) introduces formula change monitoring, new BYROW and BYCOL functions, and a revamped pivot filtering system. It also delivers improved chart rendering and allows inline styling in HTML exports.

#### New Feature

- **Formula Monitoring**: Track changes during cell insert/delete operations.
- **BYROW/BYCOL Support**: Enables lambda functions BYROW and BYCOL in formula evaluation.

#### Enhancement

- **Fraction Parsing**: Handle inputs like ‚Äú33 1/3‚Äù as valid numerics in formulas.
- **PCL Rendering**: Support complex brush types (Linear, Path, Hatch, Texture) in PCL.
- **HTML Export**: Place inline styles inside HTML tags for cleaner output.
- **Pivot Filtering API Overhaul**: Fine-grained filter methods by value, label, date, top 10, etc.
- **Date Filter Range**: Use entire day periods in date filters.
- **Filter Metadata**: Access categories, values, date types, and measure indices of filters.
- **Improved Warning System**: Unified exception and warning handling with specific enums.
- **DLL Metadata**: Adds product versioning into the compiled library.

#### Fix

- Resolved Linux crash with `libcurl` and `openssl` integration.
- Fixed Excel-to-PDF conversion issues: clipping, missing labels, subtitle errors, and alignment problems.
- Addressed incorrect chart and checkbox rendering to image/PDF/HTML.
- Fixed formula evaluation discrepancies (e.g., wrong results, corrupted files with Python formulas).
- Corrected pivot behavior when refreshing or modifying filter values.
- Fixed HTML import bugs such as ignored table rows and font settings overwrites.
- Prevented segmentation faults and NullReferenceExceptions when loading or accessing malformed files.
