- **SmartArt & Shapes API**: New methods for Scribble, SignatureLine, and ShapePaths.
- **In-Cell Image Placement**: Now supports image embedding in `MemoryPreference` mode.
- **Image in Formula Result**: Enable image output as formula result.
- **Conditional Image Rendering**: Apply the same image under conditional formatting.
- **External Pivot Sources**: Access relationships and connections for external pivot sources.
- **Freeform Shapes**: Enhanced shape drawing using vector path commands.

#### Enhancement

- **Multi-Threaded Formatting**: Use formatting features safely across threads.
- **Chart Resolution Control**: Set default image resolution via `WorkbookSettings`.
- **Improved SVG Output**: Better SVG rendering across frameworks.
- **Data Model Access**: Get table relationships and data model structures.
- **Rich Cell Values**: Copy/inspect entity-rich values including errors.
- **AutoFilter Improvements**: Refined logic for AutoFilter removal visibility.
- **Pivot Enhancements**: Set item properties, calculated states, and connection sources.
- **Text Options Update**: Better control over text formatting APIs.
- **Metadata and Signature Fixes**: Improved digital signature and metadata handling.
