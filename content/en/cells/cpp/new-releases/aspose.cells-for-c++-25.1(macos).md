#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Cells for C++ 25.1 (macOS) introduces support for external table reference evaluation, improved pivot table styling, optimized HTML export using CSS, and resolves font and rendering issues in PDF/XPS/chart outputs.

#### New Feature

- **Spilled Array Preservation**: Keep original formula values by skipping custom evaluation.
- **Pivot Range Management**: Select pivot fields and extract pivot areas into cell ranges.

#### Enhancement

- **New Pivot Format API**: Replaces old formatting system with `PivotConditionalFormatCollection`.
- **ODS Shape Output**: Export complex shapes directly into ODS format.
- **Style Creation Options**: Create custom styles with default cloning control.
- **Optimized HTML Export**: Reduce HTML size with shared base64 image handling using CSS properties.
- **Custom Engine Formula Evaluation**: Support user-managed external reference calculation.

#### Fix

- Fixed HYPERLINK and INDIRECT formula issues with data types and case sensitivity.
- Resolved corrupted outputs when working with ODS, JSON, and Python formula content.
- Corrected font styling, strikethrough, and italics issues in chart to image/XPS/PDF.
- Eliminated smart tag residue in output files and incorrect pivot filters on ‚Äú(blank)‚Äù values.
- Prevented NullReferenceExceptions when importing smartmarker JSON or recalculating pivots.
