### Object Retrieval

Effortlessly retrieve objects from collections using a syntax that feels natural for C++ programmers. This includes the introduction of the `Get(int)` method, replacing the older `GetObjectByIndex`.

### Clarity with Interface Naming Conventions

We've made improvements to interface naming conventions, providing slightly more descriptive names for better readability. For example, `GetIWorksheets` has been simplified to `GetWorksheets`.

### Optimized String Handling

This update brings new interfaces specifically designed for working with strings within your C++ applications on macOS. For instance, you can now leverage `Shape::AddHyperlink(const char16_t* address)` for hyperlink creation within your spreadsheets.

### More Highlights

- **Level Up with Modern Syntax:** The newest version of Aspose.Cells for C++ introduces a significant upgrade to object interaction and initialization. This translates to cleaner, more readable code that closely aligns with the C++ standards on macOS.
- **Update on User-defined Formulas:** The functionality for user-defined formulas has seen some changes. The `ICustomFunction` base class has been replaced with `AbstractCalculationEngine`, and its related functions are still under development. We advise using them with caution for now.
- **TIFF Image Export:** While Aspose.Cells for C++ offers different image export options, TIFF generation is not currently supported in this version. We recommend exploring alternative formats for your image export needs.
