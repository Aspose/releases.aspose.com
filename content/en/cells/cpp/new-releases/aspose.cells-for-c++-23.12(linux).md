### Write Cleaner, More Modern C++ Code

The latest update to Aspose.Cells for C++ brings a refresh to object interaction and initialization. This means your code will be easier to read and maintain, adhering more closely to the C++ standards you're familiar with on Linux.

### Effortless Object Access

Version 23.12 of the C# API replaces `GetObjectByIndex` with the intuitive `Get(int)` method, allowing you to effortlessly retrieve objects from collections with a syntax that feels natural in C++.

### Improved Clarity with Interface Naming

We've fine-tuned the naming conventions for interfaces, making them slightly more descriptive for better understanding. For instance, `GetIWorksheets` has been streamlined to `GetWorksheets`.

### Enhanced String Handling

This update introduces new interfaces specifically designed for working with strings within your C++ Excel applications. For example, you can now use `Shape::AddHyperlink(const char16_t* address)` for effortless hyperlink creation.

### More Highlights

- **Support fo TIFF Images:** TIFF generation is currently not supported in this version. Please feel free to explore alternative formats while exporting to images.
- **User-defined Formula Update:** The functionality for user-defined formulas has undergone some changes. The `ICustomFunction` base class has been replaced with `AbstractCalculationEngine`, and its related functions are still under development. We recommend using them with caution for now.
