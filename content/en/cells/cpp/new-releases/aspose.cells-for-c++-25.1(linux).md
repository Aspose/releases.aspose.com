- **External Table Ref Calculation**: Leverage user engines for evaluating external references.
- **Pivot ConditionalFormat Overhaul**: New API replacing `PivotFormatCondition` series.
- **HTML Export Upgrade**: Optimized CSS custom property usage improves performance.
- **Blazor Compatibility**: Updated dependencies and trimming for .NET 9 and SkiaSharp 3.116.1.

#### Fix

- Fixed Linux-specific issues with loading and license setup in Blazor WASM apps.
- Corrected chart rendering defects (bar overlap, axis clipping, font styles) in PDF/XPS.
- Resolved TEXTSPLIT, HYPERLINK, and INDIRECT function miscalculations.
- Fixed alignment, formatting, and font-size inconsistencies in XLSX generation.
- Addressed crashes on pivot replacements and formula recalculations.
