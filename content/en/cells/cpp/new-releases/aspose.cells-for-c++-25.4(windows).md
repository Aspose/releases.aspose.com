#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Cells for C++ 25.4 (Windows) introduces support for exporting editable charts to Word, enhanced SVG export APIs, and metadata sensitivity labels. This release significantly improves Numbers format support and resolves a wide range of bugs in rendering, layout, and formula calculation.

#### New Feature

- **Editable Charts to DOCX**: Export charts as editable shapes in Word documents.
- **SVG Export API**: New `SvgImageOptions` class for fine control over SVG output.
- **Sensitivity Labels**: Read/write support for Microsoft sensitivity labels.
- **HTML Sheet Selection**: Save specified sheets only when exporting to HTML.
- **Numbers Format Upgrade**: Now supports hidden rows/columns and fill settings in `.numbers`.

#### Enhancement

- **LowCode Namespace**: New simplified APIs under `Aspose::Cells::LowCode` for quick operations.
- **Multi-level Chart Axis to Word**: Export charts with complex categories and date axes to DOCX.
- **Workbook Save Optimization**: Improved handling of performance and shape repositioning logic.

#### Fix

- Fixed crashes in `CalculateFormula()` with data tables and dynamic array chains.
- Resolved incorrect #NUM! and #VALUE! errors in functions like VLOOKUP, TRANSPOSE, SORT.
- Corrected multiple chart rendering bugs (labels, legends, EMF cropping, font shifts).
- Eliminated shape misalignment, text box distortions, and WordArt issues in PDF output.
- Prevented Excel file corruption on save/load, especially with sparklines and merged files.
- Fixed exceptions in merging XLS files, adding HTML, and PowerQuery data access.
