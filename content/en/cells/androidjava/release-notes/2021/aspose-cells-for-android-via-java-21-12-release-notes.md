## **Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes**

The following is a list of any changes made to the public API such as added, renamed, removed or deprecated members as well as any non-backward compatible change made to Aspose.Cells for Android via Java. If you have concerns about any change listed, please raise it on the Aspose.Cells support forum.

### **Adds overloaded method Name.GetRefersTo().**

Gets the formula expression based on the specified cell.

### **Adds overloaded method Range.AutoFill().**

Automatically fill the target range with filling type.

### **Adds Comment.IsThreadedComment property.**

Indicates whether this comment is threaded comment.

### **Adds HtmlSaveOptions.IgnoreInvisibleShapes property.**

Indicates whether ingoring invisible shapes when saving html.

### **Adds Range.CurrentRegion property.**

Returns a range bounded by any combination of blank rows and blank columns.

### **Adds AxisBins class.**

 Represents axis bins for Histogram Charts.

### **Adds method SheetRender.GetPageSizeInch(int pageIndex)**

Get page size of output image?in unit of inch.

### **Adds method WorkbookRender.GetPageSizeInch(int pageIndex)**

Get page size output image?in unit of inch.

### **Adds enum CellValueFormatStrategy.DisplayString.**

With this strategy, Cell.GetStringValue(CellValueFormatStrategy) will take the limit of column width into account when formatting cell's values with the display style. If the formatted result exceeds the available width, one or more "#" may be returned, just like what ms excel shows for such kind of cells.

### **Adds WorksheetCollection.ActiveSheetName property.**

Gets and sets the active sheet name of the workbook.

### **Adds JsonLoadOptions and JsonSaveOptions classes.**

Represents the options of loading or saving the files.

### **Adds ImageSaveOptions.StreamProvider property.**

Provide the streams if there are two or more pages.

### **Adds LoadFormat.Image and LoadFormat.Json enum.**

Represents the image and json type.

### **Adds SaveFormat.Bmp, SaveFormat.Emf,SaveFormat.Gif,SaveFormat.Jpg,SaveFormat.Json and SaveFormat.Png enum**

New supported save formats.

### **Adds FileFormatType.Emf,FileFormatType.Gif,FileFormatType.Jpg,FileFormatType.Json,FileFormatType.Png,FileFormatType.Wmf enum**

New supported file format types.

### **More constraints for adding areas for Validation.**

We have changed the area model for Validation and Conditional formatting for performance consideration. The new model requires more constraints for the added areas sequence. For Validation.AddArea(CellArea cellArea, bool checkIntersection, bool checkEdge) and Validation.AddAreas(CellArea[] areas, bool checkIntersection, bool checkEdge), if the two "check" parameters are false, user needs to make sure that the added areas are sorted in ascending order by the top-left corners. Otherwise unexpected result may be got for other operations. In new version, because the performance of adding large amount of areas has been improved significantly, we don't think Validation.AddArea(CellArea cellArea) will be bottleneck anymore. So we think users may just call AddArea(CellArea cellArea) directly, without the need of using those two special methods.

### **Changed behavior for changing areas of Validation/ConditionalFormatting.**

For Validation and ConditionalFormatting, in old versions their areas may be backed by the CellArea object got from or set to them. So if user changes the field value of CellArea object, the areas may be changed too, and vice-versa. In fact this is unexpected result from the view of API design. From this version, this side effect has been removed and user cannot change the areas by changing the CellArea object any more.

### **Changed behavior for adding format condition into FormatConditionCollection.**

For FormatConditionCollection.AddCondition(...) methods, old versions make the priority of newly added one as the lowest. It is different from ms excel's behavior. From this version, just as what you will get for the operation in ms excel, we make the newly added format condition's priority as the highest.

### **Adds AbstractInterruptMonitor.TerminateWithoutException property.**

This property denotes when an interruption has been required for a process, whether the process should be terminated by an Exception or just exit quietly. By default this property is false, that is, process will be terminated by an Exception when it is interrupted.

### **Adds WorkbookSettings.ResourceProvider property.**

Renamed property for WorkbookSettings.StreamProvider to make it more suitable for its function and easier for users to understand.

### **Adds LoadDataFilterOptions.Revision option.**

Some template files may contain large amount of revision logs and that cause poor performance for loading the workbook. User may use this option to control whether those revision logs should be loaded or not.

### **Adds JsonLoadOptions.MultipleWorksheets property.**

Indicates whether importing each attribute of JsonObject object as one worksheet when all child nodes are array nodes.

### **Adds FileFormatType.SqlScript, SaveFormat.SqlScript and SqlScriptSaveOptions**

Represents the options of saving sql script.

### **Adds SaveFormat.Xml, LoadFormat.Xml, XmlSaveOptions and XmlLoadOptions**

Represents the options of R/W xml files.

### **Adds HtmlSaveOptions.SaveAsSingleFile property.**

Indicates whether saving excel as a single file. 

### **Adds JsonLoadOptions.MultipleWorksheets property.**

Indicates whether loading the data of Json file to multiple worksheets 

### **Adds PdfSaveOptions.Producer property.**

Use SheetRender.GetPageSizeInch(int pageIndex) instead.
