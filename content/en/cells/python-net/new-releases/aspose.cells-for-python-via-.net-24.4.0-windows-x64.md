### Export Charts from Numbers Files to XLSX

You can now export charts from Numbers files to XLSX format and ensure seamless data exchange between different spreadsheet applications Windows x64.

### Powerful Formula Handling

We’ve introduced new features in Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET 24.4.0 to enhance formula handling. Another new addition is the support for empty-string formulas, allowing developers to work with cells containing formulas that evaluate to empty strings. Such cells will now be treated as blanks when deleting rows or columns.

### Padding Space Control

With this release of the spreadsheet processing Python API, users can control how padding spaces are handled for formulas in the `GridWeb` component.

### Interrupt Monitor

A new, simplified implementation of an interrupt monitor allows for a more convenient user experience with spreadsheet processing tasks.

### Custom Cell Color Settings

Using version 24.4.0, users can seamlessly set custom red color values for cell text within the `GridDesktop` component on Windows 64-bit systems.

### Embedding Enhancements

Aspose.Cells for Python API version 24.4.0 introduces the functionality of embedding OLE objects as attachments while converting Excel to PDF. Furthermore, you can now directly embed images into cells within XLSB files.

### Optimized Numbers Exports Features

Developers can now choose to hide rows and columns and preserve merged cells when exporting Numbers files to XLSX format. 

### Improved Image Handling

Enjoy multiple upgrades to the image handling features in your Windows 64-bit apps with the ability to export images in cells to HTML, copy embedded images, retrieve metadata of web images, and more.

### Enhanced JSON Export

You can now export spreadsheet ranges to JSON format as an array of arrays for improved data structure. 

### Dynamic Array Formula Support

In this update, the Dynamic Array Formula feature is now supported for copying.

### External Link Validation

With the addition of a new `Type` property in the latest release, users can determine the path validity of the external links within spreadsheets.

### Bug Fixes

We have addressed several bugs in this version related to text box alignment, missing SVG images in PDF files, formula calculation, chart rendering errors, PDF export, HTML import/export, and more to ensure a more stable API usage experience.
