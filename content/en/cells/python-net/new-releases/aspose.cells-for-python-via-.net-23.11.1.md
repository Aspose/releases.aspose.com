Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET 23.11.1 removes the complexity of working with Excel files from Python environments. Using our API, you can develop full-featured spreadsheet processing solutions in Python via .NET integration and manage your worksheets, cells, formatting, formulas, charts, and more.

### Enhanced Licensing

This release addresses a critical licensing issue that previously caused an "Authentication failed" exception for metered licenses. This fix ensures smoother operation and streamlines the licensing process for developers using metered licenses of the Excel manipulation API.
