### Export XLSX Charts from Numbers Files

Effortlessly convert charts from Numbers files into the widely compatible XLSX format to ensure convenient data exchange between different Windows x32 spreadsheet apps.

### Formula Handling Optimizations

Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET 24.4.0 intelligently handles workbook cells containing formulas that evaluate to empty strings. While deleting rows or columns, the Python API will treat such cells as blank.

### Padding Space Control

You can now take control of how padding spaces are handled for formulas within the `GridWeb` component.

### Customized Cell Color and Interrupt Monitor

The updates to version 24.4.0 enable using a simplified interrupt monitor for a better user experience with spreadsheet processing tasks. Additionally, users can set custom red color values for cell text within the `GridDesktop` component on Windows 32-bit systems.

### Embedding Images and Attachments

Developers can now embed images directly into cells within XLSB files. Embedding OLE objects as attachments during Excel to PDF conversions is also supported.

### Hiding Rows/Columns and Merged Cell Support

Using this release, seamlessly hide rows and columns and preserve merged cells when exporting Numbers files to XLSX format.Â 

### Improved Image Handling

Image handling functionality sees multiple upgrades in the latest version with the export of images in cells to HTML capabilities, web image metadata retrieval, copying embedded images, and more.

### Enhanced JSON Export

Exporting spreadsheet ranges to JSON format as an array of arrays within your Windows 32-bit solutions is now supported. 

### Work with Dynamic Array Formula

Copying the Dynamic Array Formula feature is now supported.

### Validate External Links

Users can determine the path validity of the external links in spreadsheets using the newly added `Type` property.

### Bug Fixes

Several bugs related to PDF export, text box alignment, formula calculation, chart rendering errors, HTML import/export, and more have been fixed in this release of the spreadsheet processing Python API.
