### Seamless Data Exchange

Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET 24.4.0 enables seamless export of charts from Numbers files to XLSX format for developers, ensuring smooth data exchange between different macOS x64 spreadsheet apps.

### Optimized User Experience on macOS x64

- **Interrupt Monitor:** A simplified interrupt monitor is introduced in this version, enabling convenient interaction with spreadsheet processing tasks on macOS x64.

### Formula Management and Padding Space Control

- **Manage Empty String Formulas:** Support for empty-string formulas is introduced in version 24.4.0. Now, cells with empty-string formulas will be treated as blank when deleting rows or columns.
- **Control Padding Space:** You can now control how padding spaces are handled for formulas within the `GridWeb` component on macOS x64 machines.

### Powerful Numbers Exports to XLSX

- **Preserving Merged Cells:** Effortlessly preserve merged cells in Numbers files during export to XLSX format.

### Enhanced Embedding Functionality

- **Export Pictures in Cell to HTML:** Export pictures within cells to HTML format to create dynamic reports and presentations.


### Improved JSON Export and Dynamic Array Formula Support

Python developers working on macOS x64 can export spreadsheet ranges to JSON format as an array of arrays with the latest API version. We have also added support for Dynamic Array Formulas copying.

### External Links Validation

With this update, users can effortlessly validate external links within spreadsheets using the new `Type` property of the spreadsheet processing Python API.
