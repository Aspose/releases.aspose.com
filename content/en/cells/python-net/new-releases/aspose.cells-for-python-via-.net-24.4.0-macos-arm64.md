### Seamless Data Exchange

Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET 24.4.0 allows streamlined export of charts from Numbers files to XLSX format for developers and ensures convenient exchange of data between different Excel processing apps running on macOS M1 systems.

### Cell Color Setting

You can now set custom red color values for cell text within the `GridDesktop` component to add a touch of personalization to your spreadsheets.

### Control Padding Space and Formula Management

- **Control Padding Space:** This version of Aspose.Cells for Python via .NET API enables controlling how padding spaces are handled for formulas within the `GridWeb` component on macOS ARM64 machines.
- **Handle Empty String Formulas:** Manage empty-string formulas in version 24.4.0 of our API. Now, cells with empty-string formulas will be treated as blank when deleting rows or columns.

### Numbers Files Export to XLSX

- **Hidden Rows and Columns:** Developers can now decide whether to hide rows and columns while exporting Numbers files to XLSX format to maintain a clean data presentation.
- **Preserving Merged Cells:** The ability to preserve merged cells in Numbers files during export to XLSX format is another new addition.

### Powerful Embedding Features

- **OLE Objects Embedding:** Embed OLE objects as attachments during Excel to PDF conversion with this update.
- **Embed Images in XLSB Files:** Users can now embed images into cells inside XLSB files to create great-looking spreadsheets on macOS M1 machines.

### Image Handling Upgrades

- **Better Image Handling:** Work with various improvements to image handling features such as copying embedded images, retrieving web image metadata, and more.
- **Export Pictures in Cell to HTML:** Export pictures within cells to HTML format to create dynamic reports.


### JSON Export and Dynamic Array Formula Support

macOS ARM64/M1 developers can export spreadsheet ranges to JSON format as an array of arrays with the latest spreadsheet processing Python API version. We have also added support for Dynamic Array Formulas copying.

### Bug Fixes

We have resolved several user-reported bugs in this version to enhance the stability and overall API usage experience.
