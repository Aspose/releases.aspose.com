## **Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes**

The following is a list of any changes made to the public API such as added, renamed, removed or deprecated members as well as any non-backward compatible change made to Aspose.Cells for Java. If you have concerns about any change listed, please raise it on the Aspose.Cells support forum.

### **Changes the default value of HtmlSaveOptions.ExcludeUnusedStyles.**

When saving html files, for old versions sometimes we remove the unused styles automatically when there are many style objects in the pool, no matter what's the value of this property. For the generated html files, excluding unused styles can make the file size smaller without affecting the visual effects. So from this version we make the default value of this property as true to make it consistent with the saving behavior. If user needs to keep all styles in the workbook for the generated html(such as the scenario that user needs to restore the workbook from the generated html later), please set this property as false while saving html.

Support user to get all leafs of one cell recursively.
