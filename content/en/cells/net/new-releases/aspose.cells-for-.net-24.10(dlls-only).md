#### Release Highlights

The DLLs-only build of Aspose.Cells for .NET 24.10 delivers focused library improvements without installer dependencies. Highlights include lazy loading support in GridJs, advanced number format types, better external data control, and robust handling of complex formula calculations.

- Retrieve pivot sources from `DataModelConnection` and external sources.
- Set formulas using `Cell.SetFormula(formula, options)` with parsing control.
- Control blank row/column deletion behavior via new `DeleteBlankOptions`.

### üõ† Enhancements
- More reliable ODS format reading/writing with pivot table options.
- Smoother rendering and object layout in HTML/PDF outputs.
- Improved parsing of custom functions and special cases (e.g., empty formula values).
- Accurate rich text splitting and chart axis display in GridJs.
- Enhanced OLAP pivot handling and classic Excel table simulation.

### üêû Fixes
- Eliminated `IndexOutOfRangeException` in pivot and formula calculations.
- Corrected formatting, layout, and text placement in rendered charts.
- Prevented structure corruption and format loss during save/export cycles.
- Fixed bookmark encoding, multiline watermarking, and missing data issues in PDF.
