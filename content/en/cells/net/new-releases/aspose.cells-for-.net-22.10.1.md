# Improved Handling of Pivot Table Timeline Filter

It was observed that PivotTable timeline filter disappeared after Microsoft Excel&reg; document is loaded and updated. This issue has now been resolved.

# `CRTX` File Format Support

This API release introduces the support for the Chart Template-XML (`CRTX`) file format. `CRTX` contains a chart template to be used typically in MS Excel&reg;. It can also be used in other Microsoft Office&reg; programs.

# Better Execution Speed of `MAXIF` Formulas

Previously, `MAXIF` formulas were taking longer time to be calculated. This issue has now been resolved.
