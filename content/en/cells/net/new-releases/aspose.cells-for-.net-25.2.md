#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Cells for .NET 25.2 (MSI) introduces asynchronous workbook operations, WPS-compatible export features, DIF/DBF support, enhanced INDIRECT ref handling, and expanded GridJs interactivity.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Async Excel Operations**: New async methods (`OpenAsync`, `SaveAsync`, `CalculateFormulaAsync`) now available for efficient, non-blocking processing.
- **Dynamic Formula Enhancements**: Supports INDIRECT refs with defined names including ‚Äú#‚Äù; lists all sheet names when referencing across multiple sheets.
- **RichText with LightCells**: LightCells API now allows assigning rich text content to cells.
- **New File Format Support**: Load and save support for `*.dif` and `*.dbf` formats.
- **WPS Compatibility**: Embedded image positioning now compatible with WPS export scenarios.
- **GridJs UI Protection**: GridJs now supports marking specific UI regions as read-only.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Copy/Paste & Scroll in GridJs**: Auto extend areas, copy number formats, right-click Excel copy support, and smart scroll triggering at edges.
- **Pivot Improvements**: Better conditional formatting application and Web Pivot source URL consistency.
- **Number Formatting**: Apply number formats to full columns and preserve styles via GridJs import/export.
- **PowerQuery Comments**: Retains comments within query formulas for better auditability.

### üõ† Fix

- Fixed Excel export corruption, incorrect validations, and image rendering issues in charts.
- Resolved `CalculateFormula` discrepancies in functions like XLOOKUP, RANK, CELL, and array formula ranges.
- Addressed SVG and PNG misalignments, label wrapping, and formatting gaps in chart rendering.

- Ensured correct display of superscripts, italics, and font styles in Excel to XPS conversion.
