# `.NUMBERS` Data Storage 5.0 Support

Added the support for data storage 5.0 of `.numbers`.

# Improved XLSX to PDF Rendering

It was observed that while converting XLSX to PDF, bar charts were not being rendered correctly. This issue has now been resolved.

# Improved Excel&reg; Chart Label Handling

This API release offers couple of fixes regarding Excel&reg; chart labels. Those are as follows:

- Chart labels were not fitting the box.
- Chart labels were being aligned vertically instead of horizontally.

# Save Table Formulas to XLSB

Support has been added to save table formulas to `XLSB`.

# Improved Support at Linux

It was observed that characters or captions written on objects such as shapes and text boxes were appearing garbled in Linux. This issue has now been resolved.
