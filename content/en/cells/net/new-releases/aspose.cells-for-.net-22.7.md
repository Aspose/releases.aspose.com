# Improved COUNTIFS Formula Support

Previously there was a problem with `COUNTIFS` formula where it treated `0` incorrectly. This issue has now been resolved.

# Better Text Rendering Support

It was observed that in some instances the text was being rendered as small squares. This issue has now been resolved.

# Convert Excel Sheets to Single-page HTML

This API release introduced an enhancement with the ability to convert all sheets in an Excel&reg; file to one page when saving as `HTML`.

# Improved Chart to Image Conversion

When we convert Chart to image format couple of issues were observed which have now been resolved. The fixed issue are as follows: 

- Different display of chart in the output image.
- 3D Pie chart not properly rendered.
