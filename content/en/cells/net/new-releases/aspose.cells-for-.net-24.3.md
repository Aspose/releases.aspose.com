### Enhanced `GridDesktop` Experience

This release of the C# Excel API enables developers to implement various filters, such as top 10, date, and text, in `GridDesktop` for easier data exploration. Enable rich text editing within cells and the formula editor box.

### Improved Formula Engine

You can disallow editing arrays and shared formulas when modifying existing formulas within your .NET Excel spreadsheets. A new addition is support for the `EVALUATE` function, further expanding the portfolio of your C# apps.

### File Conversion

Develop spreadsheet conversion apps in C# that adhere to the ODF 1.3 standard when converting spreadsheets to ODS format. You can also process navigation links during the AZW3 to XLSX conversion.

### Other Highlights
- **X-axis Value Alignment:** Enhanced X-axis value alignment options have been added for charts.
- **Formula Menu Order:** Added categorization & formula menu order management features for GridJS.
- **Date Format Setting:** Automatic date format setting for formulas related to creation dates in GridJS is added.
- **Bug Fixes and Enhancements:** A host of bug fixes and feature enhancements related to formula calculations, parsing, double precision values, data shift, and chart data accuracy were added.
