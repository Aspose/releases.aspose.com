## **Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes**

The following is a list of any changes made to the public API such as added, renamed, removed or deprecated members as well as any non-backward compatible change made to Aspose.Cells for .NET. If you have concerns about any change listed, please raise it on the Aspose.Cells support forum.

### **Adds enum ShapePathPointValueType.**

Specifies the value type of ShapePathPoint object.

### **Adds ShapePathPoint.Type property.**

Specifies the value type (position coordinate or angle marker) of the current object.

### **Adds ShapePathPoint.XPixel/YPixel properties.**

When the object is a position coordinate, get or set the x/y coordinate in pixels.

### **Adds ShapePathPoint.XAngle/YAngle properties.**

When the object is an angle marker, get or set the first/second angle in degrees.

### **Obsoletes ShapePathPoint.X/Y property.**

Please use ShapePathPoint.XPixel/YPixel or XAngle/YAngle instead in units of pixels/degrees accordingly.

### **Obsoletes ShapePathPointCollection.Add method.**

Please use the MoveTo, LineTo, CubicBezierTo and ArcTo methods of ShapePath instead.

### **Obsoletes WorkbookDesigner.Process(Range,Boolean) method and WorkbookDesigner.LineByLine property.**

Please use range smart marker instead.
In order to process all smart markers of a range before the version 25.8, the range must be named as `_CellsSmartMarkers` and `WorkbookDesigner.LineByLine` must be false.

For example: if we need to process all smart markers in the range `A1:D4`, in the old versions, we have to name the range `A1:D4` as `_CellsSmartMarkers` and `LineByLine` as false, then we can process them together; Starting from 25.8, we only need to set the first smart marker in the range as `&=table.column1(range:A1:D4)`.

### **Adds WorkbookDesigner.SortDataSource property.**

Indicates whether to sort data source. Only works for JSON data source now.

### **Adds WorkbookSettings.SmartTagOptions property.**

Gets the default settings for smart tags.

### **Adds PasteOptions.KeepOldTables property.**

Indicates whether to keep tables in the destination range.

### **Adds MarkdownLoadOptions class.**

Represents the options for loading markdown document.

### **Adds enum ChartColorPaletteType.**

Enumerates all Monochromatic Palettes used in Excel chart.

### **Adds method SeriesCollection.ChangeColors(ChartColorPaletteType type).**

Sets Monochromatic Palette for chart series.
