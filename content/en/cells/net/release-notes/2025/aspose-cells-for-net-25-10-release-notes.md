## **Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes**

The following is a list of any changes made to the public API such as added, renamed, removed or deprecated members as well as any non-backward compatible change made to Aspose.Cells for .NET. If you have concerns about any change listed, please raise it on the Aspose.Cells support forum.

### **Changes behavior of Workbook.CalculateFormula(...) methods for refreshing dynamic array formulas.**

Dynamic array formulas are becoming more and more popular in more and more users' cases. Old versions of Aspose.Cells required users to call Workbook.RefreshDynamicArrayFormulas(...) explicitly before calling Workbook.CalculateFormula() if there are dynamic array formulas that need to be refreshed. Starting from 25.10, we include this step into Workbook.CalculateFormula(...) automatically. So users do not need to explicitly call Workbook.RefreshDynamicArrayFormulas(...) anymore before calculating formulas for the workbook.

### **Adds property RefreshDynamicArrayFormula for CalculationOptions.**

Indicates whether dynamic array formulas in a workbook should be refreshed automatically when using this CalculationOptions to calculate formulas.

### **Adds property UserSpecifiedRefreshDynamicArrayFormula for CalculationOptions.**

Indicates whether user has specified CalculationOptions.RefreshDynamicArrayFormula property explicitly. If true, then use the specified value to determine whether to refresh dynamic array formulas. If false, whether refresh dynamic array formulas depends on what kind of formulas need to be calculated with this CalculationOptions. If it is to calculate formulas for the whole workbook, then dynamic array formulas will be refreshed automatically. If it is to calculate formulas for one cell or worksheet, then dynamic array formulas will not be refreshed.

### **Adds SignificantDigitsType enum.**

Represents the type of significant digits for outputting numeric values.

### **Adds SignificantDigitsType property for WorkbookSettings and CellsHelper.**

Indicates how to control the significant digits when outputing numeric values.

### **Obsoletes SignificantDigits property of WorkbookSettings and CellsHelper.**

Uses SignificantDigitsType instead.

### **Adds property SplitTablesByBlankRow for MarkdownSaveOptions.**

Indicates whether blank rows in the worksheet should be treated as table separators when exporting to Markdown.

### **Adds property WorkbookSettings.MaxUniqueItemsPerField.**

Represents the limitation of unique items per pivot field.

Adds property Config.CustomPdfSaveOptions in GridJs.
Represents the the custom PdfSaveOptions for PDF export. If set, this will be used instead of the default PdfSaveOptions.

Adds property GridJsOptions.CustomPdfSaveOptions in GridJs.
Represents the the custom PdfSaveOptions for PDF export. If set, this will be used instead of the default PdfSaveOptions.
