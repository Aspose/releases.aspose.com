## **Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes**

### **Changes default date format for locale of Japan.**

For default date format(built-in number 14 for the number formatting), old versions of ms excel use the pattern of "yyyy/MM/dd" to format date value. But in office 365, now ms excel uses the pattern of "yyyy/M/d" instead. Now that some users require to get the same result with what they get in office 365, starting from 25.9 we use "yyyy/M/d" to format date by default.
