### **Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes**
The following is a list of any changes made to the public API such as added, renamed, removed or deprecated members as well as any non-backward compatible change made to Aspose.Cells for .NET. If you have concerns about any change listed, please raise it on the Aspose.Cells support forum.
#### **Change behavior of formatting features for some user-specified CultureInfos.(.NET ONLY)**
In old versions, our formatting engine may modify some properties of some special cultures to get the general formatted result. For example, for most situations, JapaneseCalendar should be used to format date-time values, so in old versions we always make CultureInfo of "ja-JP" use JapaneseCalendar for formatting. However, it is not always intended for users when they specify their custom CultureInfo by APIs, such as WorkbookSettings.CultureInfo or CustomImplementationFactory.CreateCultureInfo(). So, from 20.3, we use CultureInfo.UseUserOverride property to decide whether change properties automatically for formatting. For the specified CultureInfo, if this property is **true**, then we take it as that user has overridden all needed properties, so we will not change it anymore for formatting. If this property is **false**, then we may modify other properties of it automatically if needed.
#### **Add property LoadFilter.SheetsInLoadingOrder.**
Users may override this property to specify the sheets and order to be loaded while importing workbooks from the template file.
#### **Deletes obsolete TickLabels.Background property**
Use TickLabels.BackgroundMode property instead.
#### **Obsoletes TickLabels.TextDirection property and adds TickLabels.ReadingOrder property**
Use TickLabels.ReadingOrder property instead.
#### **Obsoletes TickLabels.DirectionTypeproperty and adds enum ChartTextDirectionType**
Represents the direction of text.
#### **Adds Shape.RemoveActiveXControl() method.**
Removes ActiveX data from the shape.
#### **Adds ThreadedComment.CreatedTime property.**
Gets and sets the created time of threaded comments.
#### **Adds Worksheet.UniqueId property.**
Gets and sets the unique id of the worksheet.
#### **Adds enum IconSetType.ColorSmilies3 and IconSetType.Smilies3.**
Represents the 3smiles icon set conditional formattings. Only for .ods file.s
#### **Adds enum TimePeriodType.LastYear,TimePeriodType.NextYear and ThisYear.**
Represents the last year, next year and this year conditional formattings. Only for .ods files.
#### **Adds WorksheetCollection.RefreshPivotTables() method.**
Refreshing all pivottables in the file.
