## **Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes**

The following is a list of any changes made to the public API such as added, renamed, removed or deprecated members as well as any non-backward compatible change made to Aspose.Cells for .NET. If you have concerns about any change listed, please raise it on the Aspose.Cells support forum.

### **Changes behavior of setting Cells.StandardWidth**

In old versions, setting standard width for worksheet does not change the width of those columns whose width is defined by default column. This caused inconsistent result when changing the sequence of setting standard width and applying row style. From 23.7, we make the width of default columns change to keep same with the new standard width when user setting this property. 

### **Obsolete FileFormatType.Numbers enum**

Please use FileFormatType.Numbers09 instead.

### **Adds FileFormatType.MicrosoftCabinet and FileFormatType.Rtf enum**

Used for detecting file format type.

### **Adds method Shape.GetActualBox()**

Gets the actual position and size of the shape (after applying rotation, flip, etc.)

### **Adds XmlLoadOptions.ConvertNumericOrDate, XmlLoadOptions.NumberFormat and XmlLoadOptions.DateFormat properties**

Represents the options of converting numberic text.

### **Adds XmlLoadOptions.IgnoreRootAttributes property**

Indicates whether ignore the attributes of xml root element.

### **Removes obsoleted CSV,TSV,ODS,Excel2003XML,XPS,TIFF,SVG,MSEquation,VSD,VSDX,ODT,ODP,ODF,ODG,XML,OTT,BMP,OTS,FODS,SXC and OTP of FileFormatType enum.**
