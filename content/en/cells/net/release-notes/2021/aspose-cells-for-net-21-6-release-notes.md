## **Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes**

The following is a list of any changes made to the public API such as added, renamed, removed or deprecated members as well as any non-backward compatible change made to Aspose.Cells for .NET. If you have concerns about any change listed, please raise it on the Aspose.Cells support forum.

### **Changes the behavior of Cell.IsErrorValue property.**

In old versions, this property only applies to formula cells. To make it consistent with other properties, from 21.6 we check non-formula cells too and if its value is error value, we also return true. User may check Cell.IsFormula property first if he only needs to check error value for formula cells.

### **Changes the behavior of Cell.Value property.**

In old versions, this property always returns DateTime object if the cell is formatted as date time and its value is numeric. From 21.6, this property returns the numeric value itself if it exceeds the maximum valid DateTime value. With this change the returned object is consistent with what shown in the formula bar of ms excel.

### **Adds Cell.IsNumericValue property.**

Provides convenient and efficient way for user to check whether one cell's value is numeric value(int, double, datetime).

### **Adds overloaded methods of Cell.SetSharedFormula()/SetArrayFormula()/SetDynamicArrayFormula().**

Support to set array formulas and shared formulas with predefined values.

### **Adds enum PdfFontEncoding.**

Represents pdf embedded font encoding.

### **Adds PdfSaveOptions.FontEncoding property.**

Gets or sets embedded font encoding in pdf.

### **Adds SlicerCacheItem.Value property.**

Returns the label text for the slicer item. Read-only.

### **Adds GlobalizationSettings.GetProtectionNameOfPivotTable() method.**

Gets the protection name in the PivotTable.

### **Adds FileFormatUtil.FileFormatToSaveFormat method.**

Converts file format to save format.
