## Convert Worksheet to Image

This code demonstrates how to convert a worksheet into an image format, which can be useful for various application needs such as embedding it into a document or a web page.

```csharp
//Create a new Workbook object
//Open a template excel file
Workbook book = new Workbook("Sheet to Image.xls");

//Get the first worksheet.
Worksheet sheet = book.Worksheets[0];

//Define ImageOrPrintOptions
ImageOrPrintOptions imgOptions = new ImageOrPrintOptions();

//Specify the image type
imgOptions.ImageType = ImageType.Jpeg;

//Render the sheet with respect to specified image/print options
SheetRender sr = new SheetRender(sheet, imgOptions);

//Render the image for the sheet
Bitmap bitmap = sr.ToImage(0);

//Save the image file
bitmap.Save("SheetImage.jpg");
```

## Using Smart Markers with Custom Objects

This snippet shows how to use Aspose.Cells' Smart Markers feature with custom objects, which is great for dynamically generating reports in Excel.

```csharp
//Instantiate the workbookdesigner object.
WorkbookDesigner report = new WorkbookDesigner();

//Get the first worksheet(default sheet) in the workbook.
Aspose.Cells.Worksheet w = report.Workbook.Worksheets[0];

//Input some markers to the cells.
w.Cells["A1"].PutValue("Test");
w.Cells["A2"].PutValue("&=MyProduct.Name");
w.Cells["B2"].PutValue("&=MyProduct.Age");

//Instantiate the list collection based on the custom class.
IList<MyProduct> list = new List<MyProduct>();

//Provide values for the markers using the custom class object.
list.Add(new MyProduct("Simon", 30));
list.Add(new MyProduct("Johnson", 33));

//Set the data source.
report.SetDataSource("MyProduct", list);

//Process the markers.
report.Process(false);

//Save the excel file.
report.Workbook.Save("Smart Marker Customobjects.xls");
```

Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

//Create a range
Range range = worksheet.Cells.CreateRange("A1", "D4");

//Merge cells
range.Merge();
