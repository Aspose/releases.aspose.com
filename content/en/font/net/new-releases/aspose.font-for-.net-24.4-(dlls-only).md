Convert your fonts to different formats effortlessly within your C# apps as we have resolved an `IndexOutOfRange` exception encountered while converting CFF fonts to SVG format. 

### WOFF2 Enhancements

We have introduced support for excluding the "DSIG" table from the set of result tables during TrueType to WOFF2 conversion.

### Updated Error Handling

The latest .NET API release includes the new `IncorrectFontDataException` class, offering optimized error handling for font-related issues.
