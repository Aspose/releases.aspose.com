## Set Line Spacing for Text Drawings

In this release of the font API the Text drawing functionality has been improved with the ability to set line spacing values. The values can be set in terms of `Pixels` or `PercentOfFontHeight`.

**Benefits**

This feature offers the following benefits to the C#, ASP.NET App developers:

- control the spacing between lines of text when drawing text to a graphics surface.
- create a more visually appealing text on your Apps UI
- make the large blocks of text more readable within your Apps

**Practical Uses**

Here are some examples of how C#, .NET App developers can use the ability to set line spacing:

- create a word processing application that allows users to specify the line spacing for their documents.
- create a text editor that allows users to specify the line spacing for their code.
- create a web application that displays news articles with a line spacing that is optimized for readability.
- create an App that displays product descriptions with a line spacing that is optimized for reading.
