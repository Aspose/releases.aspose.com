## Linear Threshold (`LTSH`) Table Support

This release of the API introduces the support for the Linear Threshold (`LTSH`) table.

This addition of the Linear Threshold (`LTSH`) table in the Font API is specifically good news for the C# .NET developers who are building Apps that need to render text using TrueType fonts.

### What is `LTHS` Table

The Linear Threshold (`LTSH`) table contains the linear threshhold values of each character in the TrueType font. The linear threshold values are used to determine whether or not a font character should be rendered.

### Benefits of using the `LTSH` Table

Here are some of the benefits of using the `LTSH` table to render text:

- **Improved quality:** Improved quality of rendered text by reducing the amount of subpixel rendering. This can make text sharper and more readable.
- **Improved performance:** Improved performance of text rendering by reducing the amount of computation, required to render each character. This can make apps render text quickly.
