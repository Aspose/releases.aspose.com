#### Release Highlights

The DLLs-only release of Aspose.Font for .NET 25.2 empowers .NET developers to gain low-level access to CFF font internals. With new provider-based APIs, developers can precisely control how Name and String INDEX tables are read, modified, or extended.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Fine-Grained Control over CFF Indexes**  
  Using `ICffIndexDataProvider`, `NameIndexDataProvider`, and `StringIndexDataProvider`, you can now customize how font metadata is handled. This is ideal for use cases that require branding, licensing info updates, or custom text structures in CFF fonts.

### üîπ Public API Changes

- **Newly Added APIs**:
  - `ICffIndexDataProvider` ‚Äì general interface for interacting with CFF indexes
  - `NameIndexDataProvider` ‚Äì provides structured access to font name records
  - `StringIndexDataProvider` ‚Äì handles editable CFF string tables

Developers can:
  - Retrieve index entries by byte array
  - Add or replace strings or names
  - Delete records programmatically

### üö´ Backwards Incompatible Changes

- **This update does not introduce any breaking changes.**  
  Existing functionality remains intact, and all new APIs are designed to integrate seamlessly without disrupting previous implementations.
