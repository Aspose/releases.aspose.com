## Support for kerning pairs in SVG converter

This version of the API release brings to you the support of kerning pairs in SVG converter.

Kerning pairs in SVG are pairs of letters that are spaced closer together than they would be if normal letter spacing were applied, which is useful for creating a visually appealing, even and less cluttered text.

Kerning pairs are especially important for fonts that contain large, ornate letters.

**Examples of Kerning**

Here are some examples of kerning:

- Without kerning, the letters "A" and "V" would be spaced too far apart, making the text look disjointed. Howeevr, they are often kerned together to make them look more connected and balanced.
- The letters "T" and "f" are often kerned together to make them look more connected.
- The letters "W" and "A" are often kerned together to make them look more balanced.

Kerning can be a powerful tool for improving the appearance of text. And our Font manipulation API makes working with kerning very easy for you.
