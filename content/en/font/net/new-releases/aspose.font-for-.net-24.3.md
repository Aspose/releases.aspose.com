Aspose.Font for .NET 24.3 (MSI installer) has arrived! This release supercharges your ability to manage fonts within your C# and VB.NET applications. 

### Effortless Text Measurement

Simplify your font processing tasks with the enhanced `TtfFontMetrics.MeasureString` method, which now supports measuring text represented by character code arrays.

### Advanced Glyph ID Rendering

Gain finer control over the rendering process within your C# apps with the groundbreaking `RenderingUtils.DrawText` method. It empowers you to render text using an array of glyph IDs.

### Bug Squashing

We have fixed the issues causing anÂ `ArgumentException` during TrueType to SVG conversion, ensuring smoother font transformations.
