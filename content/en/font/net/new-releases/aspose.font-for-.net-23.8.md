## CFF Font Text Rendering Fix

A bug in the C# .NET API has been fixed. The bug was causing an `IndexOutOfRangeException` to be thrown when the `MeasureString()` method was used to measure the size of a string for a `CFF` font.

This bug could cause C# .NET apps to crash, especially if they were using CFF fonts to render text.

**Benefits**

Bug resolution of this issue means that now the C# .NET App developers have the following benefits:

- Measure the size of a string or line of code
- Application containing CFF fonts will not crash when a user interacts with it
