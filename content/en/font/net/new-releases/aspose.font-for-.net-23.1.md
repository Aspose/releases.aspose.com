## Fonts to SVG Conversion Support

This release of the Fonts Manipulation API adds the feature to convert Font to SVG format.

Converting fonts to SVG format offers a number of benefits, including:

- **Scalability:** SVG fonts are scalable, meaning that they can be resized without losing quality. This makes them ideal for use in web pages and other digital applications, where fonts may need to be displayed at different sizes.
- **Flexibility:** SVG fonts can be styled using CSS, which gives designers more flexibility in terms of how they use and display fonts. For example, SVG fonts can be colored, stroked, and filled with different patterns.
- **Accessibility:** SVG fonts are more accessible than traditional bitmap fonts. This is because SVG fonts can be read by screen readers and other assistive technologies.
- **Performance:** SVG fonts can improve the performance of web pages and other digital applications. This is because SVG fonts are smaller in size than traditional bitmap fonts.
