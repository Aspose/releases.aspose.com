## Fetch Glyph ID for Specific `Type1` Font

It was observed that, there was an issue with a specific `Type1` font that caused it to return an incorrect glyph id. This could lead to text being rendered incorrectly, especially for complex characters or languages.

This issue has now been resolved within the API which means that C#, .NET app developers can now be confident that the glyph id returned by a `Type1` font is correct, and that text will be rendered correctly.

This is a significant improvement for C#, .NET app developers who need to render text using `Type1` fonts.

This fix enables you to create visually accurate and readable text layouts for a variety of Apps.
