The Aspose.Font for .NET 24.3 (DLLs-only package) is perfect for scenarios where MSI installers are not required. It enhances your ability to manage fonts within your C# and VB.NET solutions.


### Advanced Text Measurement

Streamline your font processing tasks using the enhanced `TtfFontMetrics.MeasureString` method, which now allows measuring text represented by character code arrays.

### Unleash Glyph ID Rendering

Developers can obtain greater control over the text rendering process within their C# apps using the groundbreaking `RenderingUtils.DrawText` method. It empowers developers to render text using an array of glyph IDs.

### Bug Squashing

We have fixed the issues causing anÂ `ArgumentException` during TrueType to SVG conversion, ensuring smoother font transformations in C# .NET.
