# What's new in the Aspose.Font for Java 24.7

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Font for Java 24.7 brings powerful enhancements for advanced typography and font handling. This release introduces full support for the TrueType Style Attributes (STAT) table, which defines axis variation metadata in variable fonts. With these capabilities, developers can now accurately access, modify, and render font styles based on specific axis configurations.

## New Features

- **Support for TrueType STAT Table:**
  - Added comprehensive support for accessing and managing STAT tables in TrueType fonts, including Axis Records and Axis Value tables (Formats 1 to 4).
  - This feature is crucial for working with variable fonts and their style attributes in modern font design.

## Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes

### Added APIs

- **STAT Table and Axis Handling:**
  - Classes: `AxisRecord`, `AxisValue`, `AxisValueTableFormat1`, `AxisValueTableFormat2`, `AxisValueTableFormat3`, `AxisValueTableFormat4`, `TtfStatTable`, and `TtfStatTable.AxisValueTableFlags`.
  - Methods to manage axis names, indices, and font style ranges.

- **Font Identification Utilities:**
  - New methods in `NameId`, `FontStyle`, `MSLanguageId`, and `MacLanguageId` for better font metadata access.

### Renamed APIs

- `NameId.URLDesigner` → `NameId.UrlDesigner`
- `NameId.URLVendor` → `NameId.UrlVendor`

### Removed APIs

- Removed methods `NameId.valueOf(String)` and `NameId.values()` to streamline enum usage.
