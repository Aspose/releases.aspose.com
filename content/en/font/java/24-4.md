# What's new in the Aspose.Font for Java 24.4

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Font for Java 24.4 introduces powerful enhancements for developers working with font rendering and measurement. This release adds support for measuring text using character code arrays and rendering text via glyph ID arrays. It also resolves a critical issue with TrueType to SVG conversion.

## New Features

- **Text Measurement by Character Code Arrays:**
  A new overload of the `TtfFontMetrics.measureString()` method allows you to measure text using an array of long character codes, providing greater flexibility for text layout calculations in custom rendering scenarios.

- **Glyph ID-Based Text Rendering:**
  The `RenderingUtils.drawText()` method family has been extended to support input as an array of `GlyphId`, enabling more precise rendering workflows directly at the glyph level.

## Bug Fixes

- **Resolved SVG Conversion Exception:**
  An `ArgumentException` that occurred during the conversion of TrueType fonts to SVG has been addressed, ensuring stable font exporting.

## Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes

### Added APIs

- `RenderingUtils.drawText(Font, GlyphId[], double)`
- `RenderingUtils.drawText(Font, GlyphId[], double, RenderingUtils.LineSpacingType, int, int)`
- `TtfFontMetrics.measureString(long[] characterCodes, double fontSize)`

These new APIs expand the font rendering and measurement toolkit for developers needing low-level control over glyph and character-based processing.
