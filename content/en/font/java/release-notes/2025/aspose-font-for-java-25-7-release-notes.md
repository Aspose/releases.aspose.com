This page contains release notes information for Aspose.Font for Java 25.7.

Added support for combining characters from different fonts of Compact Font Format (**CFF**).
Current functionality for combining CFF fonts is limited in that the use of compound glyphs (glyphs that require subroutines to draw themselves) is not supported. Only glyphs that
don't reference subroutines can be combined into a resultant font.
