This page contains Release Notes for **Aspose.Font for JavaScript via C++ 24.4**

{{% /alert %}}

We are pleased to announce the release of the first version of Aspose.Font for JavaScript via C++ 24.4. 

Aspose.Font for JavaScript via C++ is an easy and secure toolkit used to work with fonts directly in the web browser. It provides the capability to load and save fonts from files. The API lets you work with multiple font formats such as TrueType (with TrueType collections), CFF, OpenType, and Type1. 

The most popular features that Aspose.Font provides are:

- Convert [supported format fonts](https://docs.aspose.com/font/javascript-cpp/product-overview/#supported-file-formats) to TrueType formats (TTF,WOFF,WOFF2) and SVG.
- Read and add or update metadata information of TrueType fonts.

For more details see [Aspose.Font for JavaScript Documentation](https://docs.aspose.com/font/javascript-cpp/).
