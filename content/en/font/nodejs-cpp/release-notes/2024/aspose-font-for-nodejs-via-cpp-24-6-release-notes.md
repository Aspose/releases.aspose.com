{{% /alert %}}

We are pleased to announce the release of the first version of Aspose.Font for Node.js via C++ 24.6. 

Aspose.Font for Node.js via C++ is an easy and secure toolkit used to work with fonts in the server side. It provides the capability to convert fonts, read and write metadata information. The API lets you work with multiple font formats such as TrueType (with TrueType collections), CFF, OpenType, and Type1. 

The most popular features that Aspose.Font provides are:

- Convert [supported format fonts](https://docs.aspose.com/font/nodejs-cpp/product-overview/#supported-file-formats) to TrueType formats (TTF,WOFF,WOFF2) and SVG.
- Read and add or update metadata information of TrueType fonts.


For more details see [Aspose.Font for JavaScript Documentation](https://docs.aspose.com/font/nodejs-cpp/).
