#### Release Highlights

This DLLs-only version of Aspose.TeX for .NET 24.12 introduces a refined API surface by removing legacy rendering methods and interfaces. It's tailored for modern CI/CD pipelines and containerized .NET apps.

### ðŸ›  Fix

- **Removed Legacy Methods from DLLs**  
  Optimized binary payload by excluding methods such as `Create`, `DrawPath`, `SetTransform`, and `ShowImage` from all device types.

### ðŸ”„ Backwards Incompatible Changes

Same list of removals as MSI applies. If you're using:
- `StartDocument`, `EndPage`, or `AddBookmark` in any custom rendering integration,
you'll need to adapt to the revised architecture.
