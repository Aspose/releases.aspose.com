#### Release Highlights

Aspose.TeX for .NET 24.12 MSI delivers a major cleanup of legacy device rendering APIs. With obsolete methods now removed, the API surface is leaner, clearer, and easier to maintain for modern .NET development workflows.

### ðŸ›  Fix

- **Deprecated Rendering API Cleanup**  
  Removed outdated methods from presentation devices (`PdfDevice`, `SvgDevice`, `XpsDevice`, `ImageDevice`, etc.), including `DrawString`, `SetClip`, `StartPage`, and others. This streamlines the library and prepares it for next-generation rendering backends.

### ðŸ”„ Backwards Incompatible Changes

Several classes and methods have been **removed** in this version:

- Removed full rendering pipelines from:
  - `Aspose.TeX.Presentation.Device`  
  - `Aspose.TeX.Presentation.Pdf.PdfDevice`  
  - `Aspose.TeX.Presentation.Svg.SvgDevice`  
  - `Aspose.TeX.Presentation.Xps.XpsDevice`  
  - `Aspose.TeX.Presentation.Image.ImageDevice`
- Removed interfaces:
  - `IFragmentRasterizer`
  - `IInteractiveDevice`
