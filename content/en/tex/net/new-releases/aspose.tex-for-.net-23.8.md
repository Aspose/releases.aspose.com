## eTeX Tracing and Diagnostics Primitives

Implemented support for eTeX tracing and diagnostics primitives. These aid in debugging and monitoring the typesetting process.

## eTeX Advanced Text Processing

Implemented support for additional eTeX token list parameters. These parameters enhance the flexibility of token manipulation in TeX documents, allowing for more advanced text processing and manipulation.

## Constructing Paragraphs via eTeX

Implementeded support for the modifications to the eTeX paragraph building algorithm. This optimizes the process for constructing paragraphs, enhancing typesetting efficiency.


## eTeX Interactive Document Processing

Added support for the \iffontchar and \readline eTeX primitives.

`\iffontchar` is an eTeX primitive for checking if a specific font character exists, enhancing font manipulation. `\readline` is another eTeX primitive that facilitates reading input, making interactive document processing more efficient.
