Aspose.TeX for C++ 24.7 delegates more control to developers to effortlessly generate high-quality LaTeX documents directly from their platform-independent C++ applications. 

### LaTeX Kernel Upgrade

The underlying LaTeX kernel has been advanced to `LaTeX3e` in the latest C++ LaTeX API release, to offer broader support for LaTeX features and improved rendering. Leverage the power of the C++ library to seamlessly integrate LaTeX document generation into your solutions. 

### API Stability

We have maintained compatibility with the previous versions in this release to ensure smooth integration into existing C++ projects across Windows, Linux, and macOS.
