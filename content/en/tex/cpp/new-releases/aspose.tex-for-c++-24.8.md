Aspose.TeX for C++ 24.8 brings different improvements and new capabilities tailored for app developers working with TeX files on Windows, Linux, and macOS. This release builds on the .NET version 24.8 and offers an expanded feature set with functionalities like \write18 support, random number primitives, and embedding the lipsum LaTeX package.
