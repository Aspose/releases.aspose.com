  - `FigureRenderer` → `FigureRendererPlugin`
  - `MathRendererOptions` → `MathRendererPluginOptions`
  - And other related renamings.

- **Simplified Device Initialization Methods:**
  Unified method signatures for initializing various rendering devices by replacing `.init()` methods with `.initialize()`.
