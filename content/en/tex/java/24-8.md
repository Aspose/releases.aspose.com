# What's new in the Aspose.TeX for Java 24.8

## Release Highlights

Aspose.TeX for Java 24.8 expands its capabilities with enhanced scripting and randomness features. The update introduces support for `\write18` execution in restricted mode, integrates the commonly used `lipsum` package, and implements random number primitives, boosting the LaTeX engine’s power for complex and dynamic document generation.

## Enhancements

- **Support for `\write18` in Restricted Mode:**
  Aspose.TeX now supports the execution of shell commands via `\write18`, with security controls in restricted shell mode to avoid unauthorized execution.

- **Embedded Lipsum Package:**
  The LaTeX `lipsum` package is now embedded by default, allowing seamless generation of placeholder text without requiring external installation.

- **Random Number Primitives for Object TeX:**
  Added primitives for generating random numbers directly in TeX, which facilitates testing and document variability.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

### Added APIs

- `com.aspose.tex.ShellMode` with values:
  - `ShellMode.NoShellEscape`
  - `ShellMode.ShellRestricted`
- New methods in `com.aspose.tex.TeXOptions`:
  - `getShellMode()`
  - `setShellMode(ShellMode)`
  - `getExecutables()`
- Command-line utility types and methods:
  - `Base64Exec`, `Executable`, `ExecutablesList`, `Write18Exception`
  - `Executable.execute(String[])`, `getCommandName()`, etc.

There are no removed or renamed APIs in this release.
