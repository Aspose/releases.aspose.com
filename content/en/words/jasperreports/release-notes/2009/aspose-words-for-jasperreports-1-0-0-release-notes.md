Please welcome our brand new product, Aspose.Words for JasperReports 1.0.0! Aspose.Words for JasperReports is the unique solution on the market that makes possible exporting reports from JasperReports and JasperServer to Microsoft Word documents and more. The export formats currently include:

- DOC - Microsoft Word documents
- DOCX - Office Open XML (OOXML) documents
- HTML - Web pages
- TXT - Plain text

The first release of the product supports the following features:

- Easy and Lightweight Deployment - Aspose.Words for JasperReports is written purely in Java and is provided as a single JAR file that can easily be deployed on the machines running JasperReports or JasperServer.
- High Fidelity to Report Design - Aspose.Words for JasperReports exports reports as Microsoft Word documents in such a way that they look identical to reports exported by the built-in exporters of JasperReports.
- Editable Documents - Aspose.Words for JasperReports exports flow layout documents. This means they consist of “normal” paragraphs, tables and images that are easy to further edit in Microsoft Word, if necessary.
