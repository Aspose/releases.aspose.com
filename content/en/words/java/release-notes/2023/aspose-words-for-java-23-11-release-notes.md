/// </param>
/// <returns>
/// The count of accepted revisions.
/// </returns>
public int Accept(IRevisionCriteria criteria);

/// <summary>
/// Rejects revisions that match specified criteria.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="criteria">
/// The <see cref="IRevisionCriteria"/> implementation.
/// </param>
/// <returns>
/// The count of rejected revisions.

/// </summary>
public interface IRevisionCriteria
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Checks whether or not specified <paramref name="revision"/> matches criteria.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="revision">The <see cref="Revision"/> instance to match criteria.</param>
    /// <returns><c>True</c> if the <paramref name="revision"/> matches criteria, otherwise <c>False</c>.</returns>
    /// <remarks>
    /// The method implementation should not accept/reject the revision or modify it in any way due to unexpected results.
    /// </remarks>
