    /// <summary>
    /// Specifies the page layout to be used when the document is opened in a PDF reader.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// The default value is PdfPageLayout.SinglePage/>.
    /// </remarks>
    public PdfPageLayout PageLayout { get; set; }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

New public **PdfPageLayout** enumeration has been introduced:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies the page layout to be used when the document is opened in a PDF reader.
/// </summary>
public enum PdfPageLayout
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Display one page at a time.
    /// </summary>
    SinglePage,

    /// <summary>
    /// Display the pages in one column.
    /// </summary>
    OneColumn,

    /// <summary>
    /// Display the pages in two columns, with odd-numbered pages on the left.
    /// </summary>
    TwoColumnLeft,

    /// <summary>
    /// Display the pages in two columns, with odd-numbered pages on the right.
    /// </summary>
    TwoColumnRight,

    /// <summary>
    /// Display the pages two at a time, with odd-numbered pages on the left.
    /// </summary>
    TwoPageLeft,

    /// <summary>
    /// Display the pages two at a time, with odd-numbered pages on the right.

/// compressed size of a file, and total size of the archive, as well as a limit of 65,535 (2^16-1) files in archive.
/// ZIP64 format extensions increase the limits to 2^64.
/// </remarks>
/// <seealso cref="OoxmlSaveOptions.Zip64Mode"/>
