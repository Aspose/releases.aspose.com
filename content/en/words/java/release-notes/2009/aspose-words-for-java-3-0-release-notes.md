{{% /alert %}}

Please welcome our next major release of Aspose.Words for Java! Support for RTF and ODT is added in this release!

## RTF Support

RTF features in Aspose.Words for Java:

- Read and write files in the RTF format of any version
- Over 95% of the RTF 1.8 Specification supported
- Unknown keywords (unsupported or from newer specifications) are safely ignored.

The RTF specification is a set of keywords. There are over 1400 keywords in the RTF 1.8 Specification. Aspose.Words for Java fully supports (reads and writes) over 95% of those keywords. It is hard to find a similar level of implementation in other products.

## ODT Support

OpenDocument Text (ODT) is the file format for word processing documents originally developed by Sun for the Open Office Writer. OpenDocument is currently an OASIS and ISO standard.
