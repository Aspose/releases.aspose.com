## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 25.1. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added new maven dependency to legacy HarfBuzz jar

Related issue: WORDSJAVA-3018 WORDSJAVA-3019

A new public maven dependency for legacy HarfBuzz jar:
{{< highlight java >}}
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
            <artifactId>aspose-words</artifactId>
            <version>25.1</version>
            <classifier>shaping-harfbuzz-legacy-plugin</classifier>
        </dependency>
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new public option HtmlFixedSaveOptions.IdPrefix and SvgSaveOptions.IdPrefix

Related issue: WORDSNET-27277

A new public option IdPrefix has been added in HtmlFixedSaveOptions and SvgSaveOptions classes:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies a prefix that is prepended to all generated element IDs in the output document.
/// Default value is null and no prefix is prepended.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// If the prefix is specified, it can contain only letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens,
/// and must start with a letter.
/// </remarks>
/// <exception cref="ArgumentException">The value does not meet the requirements specified above.</exception>
public string IdPrefix
{
    get { return mIdPrefix; }
    set
    {
        AssertValidIdPrefix(value);
        mIdPrefix = value;
    }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to specify a prefix that is prepended to all generated element IDs in the output HTML document:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "c012c14781944ce4cc5e31f35b08060a" "id-prefix.java" >}}

This use case explains how to specify a prefix that is prepended to all generated element IDs in the output SVG document:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "c012c14781944ce4cc5e31f35b08060a" "id-prefix-svg.java" >}}

### Added new public option RemoveJavaScriptFromLinks to HtmlFixedSaveOptions and SvgSaveOptions.

Related issue: WORDSNET-27520
{{< highlight csharp >}}
A new public option RemoveJavaScriptFromLinks has been added in HtmlFixedSaveOptions and SvgSaveOptions classes:

/// Specifies whether JavaScript will be removed from links.
/// Default is <c>false</c>.
/// If this option is enabled, all links containing JavaScript will be replaced with "javascript:void(0)".
/// </summary>
public bool RemoveJavaScriptFromLinks { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to specify whether JavaScript will be removed from links:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "c012c14781944ce4cc5e31f35b08060a" "remove-java-script-from-links.java" >}}
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "c012c14781944ce4cc5e31f35b08060a" "remove-java-script-from-links-svg.java" >}}

### Added possibility to check Grammar using OpenAi

Related issue: WORDSNET-27676

/// This operation leverages the connected AI model for checking grammar of document.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="sourceDocument">The document being checked for grammar.</param>
/// <param name="options">Optional settings to control how grammar will be checked.</param>
/// <returns>A new <see cref="Document"/> with checked grammar.</returns>
Document CheckGrammar(Document sourceDocument, CheckGrammarOptions options = null);
{{< /highlight >}}

Also, added a new public class into Aspose.Words.AI namespace:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Allows to specify various options while checking grammar of a document using AI.
/// </summary>
public class CheckGrammarOptions
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to check grammar of a document using OpenAi generative model with revisions:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "f86d49dc0e6781b93e576539a01e6ca2" "ai-grammar.cs" >}}
