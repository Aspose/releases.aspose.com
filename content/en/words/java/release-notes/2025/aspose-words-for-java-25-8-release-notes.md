## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 25.8. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added new public enumeration MarkdownExportAsHtml.NonCompatibleTables

Related issue: WORDSNET-28289

A new public flag has been added into [Aspose.Words.Saving.MarkdownExportAsHtml](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.saving/markdownexportashtml/) enumeration:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Export tables that cannot be correctly represented in pure Markdown as raw HTML.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para> When this option is enabled, Aspose.Words will only export tables that have merged cells
/// or nested tables as raw HTML. And all other tables will be exported in Markdown format.
/// Also note, this option will not preserve all formatting of the table, but only preserves
/// corresponding spans of the cells.</para>
/// <para>If related <see cref="Tables"/> flag is set, then this flag will be ignored.</para>
/// </remarks>
NonCompatibleTables = 0x0002
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case describes how to export only those tables as HTML that cannot be accurately represented using plain Markdown:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "571cc6e23284a2ec075d15d4c32e3bbf" "non-compatible-tables.cs" >}}

### Added new public option FindReplaceOptions.IgnoreOfficeMath

Related issue: WORDSNET-28249

A new public option has been added into [Aspose.Words.Replacing.FindReplaceOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.replacing/findreplaceoptions/findreplaceoptions/) class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a boolean value indicating either to ignore text inside OfficeMath/>.
/// The default value is <c>true</c>.
/// </summary>
public bool IgnoreOfficeMath {get; set;}
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to replace text in OfficeMath:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "571cc6e23284a2ec075d15d4c32e3bbf" "ignore-office-math.cs" >}}

### Added new public property AsposeWordsPrintDocument.PagesRemaining

Related issue: WORDSNET-28439

A new public property [PagesRemaining](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.rendering/asposewordsprintdocument/pagesremaining/) providing the number of pages remaining in the current print job was added to [AsposeWordsPrintDocument](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.rendering/asposewordsprintdocument/asposewordsprintdocument/) class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets the number of pages remaining in the currently active print job.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This value is updated automatically as pages are printed, reflecting the current print job's progress.
/// Outside of print time and in case of print job errors or interruptions, the value may not reflect the
/// actual number of pages pending.
/// </remarks>
public int PagesRemaining { get; }
{{< /highlight >}}

This makes it much easier to track print jobs.

Sample Print Tracker Implementation:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "571cc6e23284a2ec075d15d4c32e3bbf" "print-tracker.cs" >}}

This use case explains how to printing a word document to PDF with event tracking using Aspose.Words:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "571cc6e23284a2ec075d15d4c32e3bbf" "print-pages-remaining.cs" >}}

### New public MarkdownLoadOptions.SoftLineBreakCharacter option has been introduced

Related issue: WORDSNET-28225

A new public option has been added into [Aspose.Words.Loading.MarkdownLoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.loading/markdownloadoptions/) class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a character value representing `soft line break`.
/// The default value is <c>SPACE (U+0020)</c>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Note, setting this option to <see cref="ControlChar.LineBreakChar"/> allows you
/// to load soft line breaks as hard line breaks.
/// </remarks>
public char SoftLineBreakCharacter {get; set;}
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to change the default soft line break character `SPACE` to some another character `\v`:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "571cc6e23284a2ec075d15d4c32e3bbf" "soft-line-break-character.cs" >}}

### New public PageExtractOptions has been introduced

Related issue: WORDSNET-28250

A new public options class [PageExtractOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/pageextractoptions/) has been introduced:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Allows to specify options for document page extracting.
/// </summary>
public class PageExtractOptions
{
  /// <summary>
  /// Specifies whether the start page number in the resulting document shall be updated.
  /// Default value is <c>true</c>.
  /// </summary>
  public bool UpdatePageStartingNumber { get; set; }

  /// <summary>
  /// Specifies whether NUMPAGES fields in the resulting document will be replaced with their actual resulting values.
  /// Default value is <c>true</c>.
  /// </summary>
  public bool UnlinkPagesNumberFields { get; set; }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to change the code behavior when extracting pages:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "571cc6e23284a2ec075d15d4c32e3bbf" "extract-pages-with-options.cs" >}}
