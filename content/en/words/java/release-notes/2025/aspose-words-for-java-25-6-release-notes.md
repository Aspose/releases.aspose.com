## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 25.6. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added multi-page export to raster image formats (PNG/JPG/etc.) with customizable layouts (Horizontal/Vertical/Grid).

Related issue: WORDSNET-28060

Introduced new public property in [Aspose.Words.Saving.ImageSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.saving/imagesaveoptions/) class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the layout used when rendering multiple pages into a single output.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Use one of the factory methods of <see cref="Saving.MultiPageLayout"/> to configure this property.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// For <see cref="SaveFormat.Tiff"/> the default value is <see cref="MultiPageLayout.TiffFrames"/>.
/// For other formats the default value is <see cref="MultiPageLayout.SinglePage"/>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This property has effect only when saving to the following formats:

/// </para>
/// </remarks>
public MultiPageLayout PageLayout { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

and added a new factory class to create the muli-page layout configurations in [Aspose.Words.Saving](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.saving/) namespace:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Defines a layout for rendering multiple pages into a single output.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Use one of the static factory methods to create a layout configuration.
/// </remarks>
public sealed class MultiPageLayout
{
/// <summary>
/// Creates a layout where all specified pages are rendered vertically one below the other in a single output.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="verticalGap">The vertical gap between pages in points.</param>
public static MultiPageLayout Vertical(float verticalGap);

/// <summary>
/// Creates a layout in which all specified pages are rendered horizontally side by side,
/// left to right, in a single output.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="horizontalGap">The horizontal gap between pages in points.</param>
public static MultiPageLayout Horizontal(float horizontalGap);

/// <summary>
/// Creates a layout in which pages are rendered left-to-right, top-to-bottom, in a grid with the
/// specified number of columns.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="columns">The number of columns in the layout. Must be greater than zero.</param>
/// <param name="horizontalGap">The horizontal gap between columns in points.</param>
/// <param name="verticalGap">The vertical gap between rows in points.</param>
/// <exception cref="ArgumentOutOfRangeException">Thrown if <paramref name="columns"/> is less than or equal to zero.</exception>
public static MultiPageLayout Grid(int columns, float horizontalGap, float verticalGap);

/// <summary>
/// Creates a layout where each page is rendered as a separate frame in a multi-frame TIFF image.
/// Applicable only to TIFF image formats.
/// </summary>
public static MultiPageLayout TiffFrames()

/// <summary>
/// Creates a layout that renders only the first of specified pages.
/// </summary>
public static MultiPageLayout SinglePage()

/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the background color of the output.
/// The default is <see cref="Color.Empty"/>.
/// </summary>
public Color BackColor { get; set; }

/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the color of the pages border.
/// The default is <see cref="Color.Empty"/>.
/// </summary>
public Color BorderColor { get; set }

/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the width of the pages border.
/// The default is 0.
/// </summary>
public float BorderWidth { get; set; }
}
