## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 25.7. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added the ability to use self-hosted LLM implementations, allowing for greater privacy and control over AI-driven features.

Related issue: WORDSNET-28298

Added new members into [Aspose.Words.AI.AiModel](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/aimodel/) class:

Added protected properties:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets model name.
/// </summary>
protected abstract string Name { get; }
/// <summary>
/// Gets URL of the model.
/// </summary>
protected abstract string Url { get; }
{{< /highlight >}}

Added public methods (instead of same methods of obsolete IAiModelText interface):
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Generates a summary of the specified document, with options to adjust the length of the summary.
/// This operation leverages the connected AI model for content processing.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="sourceDocument">The document to be summarized.</param>
/// <param name="options">Optional settings to control the summary length and other parameters.</param>
/// <returns>A summarized version of the document's content.</returns>
public abstract Document Summarize(Document sourceDocument, SummarizeOptions options = null);
/// <summary>
/// Generates summaries for an array of documents, with options to control the summary length and other settings.
/// This method utilizes the connected AI model for processing each document in the array.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="sourceDocuments">An array of documents to be summarized.</param>
/// <param name="options">Optional settings to control the summary length and other parameters</param>
/// <returns>A summarized version of the document's content.</returns>
public abstract Document Summarize(Document[] sourceDocuments, SummarizeOptions options = null);
/// <summary>
/// Checks grammar of the provided document.
/// This operation leverages the connected AI model for checking grammar of document.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="sourceDocument">The document being checked for grammar.</param>
/// <param name="options">Optional settings to control how grammar will be checked.</param>
/// <returns>A new <see cref="Document"/> with checked grammar.</returns>
public virtual Document CheckGrammar(Document sourceDocument, CheckGrammarOptions options = null)
/// <summary>
/// Translates the provided document into the specified target language.
/// This operation leverages the connected AI model for content translating.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="sourceDocument">The document to be translated.</param>
/// <param name="targetLanguage">The language into which the document will be translated.</param>
/// <returns>A new <see cref="Document"/> object containing the translated document.</returns>
public abstract Document Translate(Document sourceDocument, Language targetLanguage);
{{< /highlight >}}

Also added new protected virtual properties into [Aspose.Words.AI.OpenAiModel](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/openaimodel/) class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets integer value representing a size of context window of the model.
/// </summary>
protected virtual int ContextWindow { get; }
/// <summary>
/// Gets integer value representing a maximum number of output tokens of the model.
/// </summary>
protected virtual int MaxOutputTokens { get; }
{{< /highlight >}}

Added new protected virtual properties into [Aspose.Words.AI.GoogleAiModel](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/googleaimodel/) class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets input token limit.
/// </summary>
protected virtual int InputTokenLimit { get; }
/// <summary>
/// Gets output token limit.
/// </summary>
protected virtual int OutputTokenLimit { get; }
{{< /highlight >}}

Added new protected virtual properties into [Aspose.Words.AI.AnthropicAiModel](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/anthropicaimodel/) class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets input token limit.
/// </summary>
protected virtual int InputTokenLimit { get; }
/// <summary>
/// Gets output token limit.
/// </summary>
protected virtual int OutputTokenLimit { get; }
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to use self-hosted LLM implementations:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "2af5a850f2e0a83c3b114274a838c092" "self-hosted-model.java" >}}

### Introduced the ReplacingArgs.MatchEndNode public property to provide developers with more precise control during text replacement operations.

Related issue: WORDSNET-28070

Implemented new public property in [Aspose.Words.Replacing.ReplacingArgs](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/replacingargs/) class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets the node that contains the end of the match.
/// </summary>
public Node MatchEndNode { get; }
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to use [MatchEndNode](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/replacingargs/#getMatchEndNode) public property:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "2af5a850f2e0a83c3b114274a838c092" "match-end-node.java" >}}

### Added the Row.Hidden public property, enabling the ability to programmatically show or hide specific rows within a table.

Related issue: WORDSNET-25899

A new public property [Hidden](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/row/#getHidden) has been added in [Row](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/row/) class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a flag indicating whether this row is hidden or not.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Hidden row is not supported for WordML.
/// </remarks>
public bool Hidden
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to programmatically show or hide specific rows within a table:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "2af5a850f2e0a83c3b114274a838c092" "hidden-row.java" >}}

### First version of OpenType Font Variation support.

Related issue: WORDSNET-18994

First version of OpenType Font Variation support has been released. Now variable font named instances are correctly laid-out both with and without HarfBuzz shaping and correctly embedded into PDF and XPS.

Limitations:
- Limited support when rendering to fixed page formats other than PDF and XPS
- Not supported glyph outlines retrieval (used in cases like WordArt text effects and 3D text effects).

Also OpenType Font Variation support affects font search cache export/import. In order for font variations to work properly, the cache should be generated in the new Aspose.Words version.

### Removed obsolete PdfSaveOptions.EmbedAttachments property.

Related issue: WORDSNET-27923

Obsolete property PdfSaveOptions.EmbedAttachments has been removed. 
[PdfSaveOptions.AttachmentsEmbeddingMode](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/pdfsaveoptions/#setAttachmentsEmbeddingMode-int) should be used instead.
