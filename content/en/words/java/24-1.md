## What's new in the Aspose.Words for Java 24.1

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Words for Java 24.1 delivers a comprehensive update with 98 enhancements and fixes. Key highlights include support for modifying TextBox OLE control content, stroke color management via new public properties, a dedicated public API for bibliography sources, and improved HTML list export behavior in the LINQ Reporting Engine. This release empowers developers with precise document formatting and metadata handling capabilities.

## New Features

- **Editable TextBox OLE Control Content:**
  A new API enables programmatic modification of text in OLE TextBox controls, significantly improving form field customization.

- **Stroke Color Customization:**
  Developers can now define foreground and background stroke colors using theme color and tint/shade properties for refined shape styling.

- **Bibliography Sources Public API:**
  Introduced a robust API to manage and access bibliography sources directly in Word documents, supporting structured citation management.

- **Restricted Type Access in LINQ Reporting Engine:**
  Added control over accessible members through template syntax, enhancing security and encapsulation in reporting workflows.

## Enhancements

- **Improved HTML List Export Logic:**
  When using `HtmlSaveOptions.ExportListLabels` with `ByHtmlTags`, all list items are now accurately exported as semantic HTML tags (`ul`, `ol`, `li`), enhancing document fidelity and interoperability.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- Added the ability to set and get the text in TextBox OLE controls via `TextBoxControl.Text`.
- Introduced `ForeThemeColor`, `BackThemeColor`, `ForeTintAndShade`, and `BackTintAndShade` to the `Stroke` class for detailed stroke appearance control.
- New classes for bibliography handling: `Bibliography`, `Source`, `ContributorCollection`, `Contributor`, `Corporate`, `PersonCollection`, `Person`, and `SourceType`.
- Modified behavior of `HtmlSaveOptions.ExportListLabels.ByHtmlTags`—lists now consistently export as HTML elements, with reduced styling preservation in round-trip conversions.
