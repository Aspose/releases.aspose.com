# What's new in the Aspose.Words for Java 24.6

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Words for Java 24.6 delivers a powerful upgrade with 84 improvements and fixes. This release focuses on extending the document automation capabilities, enhancing charting tools, optimizing rendering performance, and refining comment and comparison features. Developers now have greater flexibility and control for creating rich, data-driven Word documents.

## New Features

- **Advanced Chart Types Added:**
  Introduced support for Treemap, Sunburst, Histogram, Pareto, Box & Whisker, Waterfall, and Funnel charts. These enable more dynamic data visualization options.

- **Shadow Format Color Access:**
  New API allows retrieval of the color used in shape shadows, giving developers more precision over document styling.

- **UTC Time Support for Comments:**
  A new `Comment.DateTimeUtc` property offers accurate comment timestamps in UTC, improving document collaboration tracking.

- **Enhanced Comparison Tools:**
  New `AdvancedCompareOptions` class added, featuring `IgnoreStoreItemId` to suppress unnecessary revisions during SDT comparisons. `IgnoreDmlUniqueId` was also moved into this class.

- **LINQ Reporting Engine Enhancements:**
  - Selectively remove paragraphs that become empty after tag processing using the `<<!tag_name>>` syntax.
  - Define custom messages for missing object members using `setMissingMemberMessage()` for more informative report generation.

## Enhancements

- **Performance Boost for Background Rendering:**
  Background rendering has been optimized using native tiling technology, dramatically improving rendering times for backgrounds with many small elements.

- **Realistic Gradient Fills:**
  Support for non-linear gradients in DrawingML (DML) shapes now mimics MS Word more closely for a professional visual appearance.

## Bug Fixes

- Resolved multiple issues across charting, rendering, and document comparison workflows, improving reliability and performance.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Chart Types:**
  Extended `ChartType` enum to support Treemap, Sunburst, Histogram, Pareto, Box & Whisker, Waterfall, and Funnel charts. Corresponding overloads added to `ChartSeriesCollection` for handling these.

- **Shadow Color Property:**
  Introduced `Color getColor()` method in `ShadowFormat` class.

- **Comment Timestamp in UTC:**
  New `DateTime getDateTimeUtc()` method added to `Comment` class.

- **AdvancedCompareOptions Introduced:**
  New `AdvancedCompareOptions` class includes `IgnoreStoreItemId` and migrated `IgnoreDmlUniqueId` from `CompareOptions`.

- **Reporting Engine Updates:**
  - Template tag prefix `!` enables conditional empty paragraph removal.
