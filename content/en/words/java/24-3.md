## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- The new TIFF rendering core introduces support for:
  - `TiffCompression.None`, `Rle`, `Lzw`, `Ccitt3`, and `Ccitt4` compression types.
  - Improved reading of TIFFs using JPEG and Old JPEG compressions.
  - Enhanced rendering fidelity and broader format support for high-quality output.

- **HtmlSaveOptions.Encoding no longer affects MOBI/AZW3 output.**
