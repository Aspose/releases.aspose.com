[Product Page](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) | [Docs](https://docs.aspose.com/words/net/) | [Demos](https://products.aspose.app/words/family) | [API Reference](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/) | [Examples](https://github.com/aspose-words/Aspose.Words-for-.NET/tree/master/Examples) | [Blog](https://blog.aspose.com/category/words/) | [Releases](https://releases.aspose.com/words/net/) | [Free Support](https://forum.aspose.com/c/words) | [Temporary License](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/)

[Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) is a powerful class library designed for C#, F#, and VB.NET developers to perform a wide range of document-processing tasks, including document generation, editing, conversion, and rendering. The library is fully self-contained and does not require any third-party software like Microsoft Word or OpenOffice. With the addition of our new AI-powered features—such as document summarization, translation, and grammar checking—you can now bring intelligent automation into your document workflows using your preferred AI model.

This package can be used to develop applications for a vast range of operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android) and [platforms](https://docs.aspose.com/words/net/supported-platforms/) such as [Windows Azure](https://docs.aspose.com/words/net/windows-azure-platform/), Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Mac. You can build both 32-bit and 64-bit software, including ASP.NET, WCF, and WinForms. Also, you can use our library via COM Interop from ASP, PHP, Perl, and Python programming languages.

> *Please note*: our library implies the use of [.NET programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CLI_languages), compatible with CLI infrastructure. If you require a corresponding native library for C++, you can download it from [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.Words.Cpp/). The Python version you can download from [here](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/).

- Supports powerful [Report Generation with Mail Merge](https://docs.aspose.com/words/net/mail-merge-and-reporting/) functionality, which allows creating documents dynamically using templates and data sources.
- Contains a flexible [LINQ Reporting Engine](https://docs.aspose.com/words/net/linq-reporting-engine/), designed to fetch data from databases, XML, JSON, OData, external documents.
- Provides a rich set of utility functions, you can use to [split a document](https://docs.aspose.com/words/net/split-a-document/) into parts, [join documents together](https://docs.aspose.com/words/net/insert-and-append-documents/), [compare documents](https://docs.aspose.com/words/net/compare-documents/), and much more.

## Getting Started

So, you probably want to jump up and start coding your document processing application on C#, F# or Visual Basic right away? Let us show you how to do it in a few easy steps.

Run ```Install-Package Aspose.Words``` from the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio to fetch the NuGet package.
If you want to upgrade to the latest package version, please run ```Update-Package Aspose.Words```.

You can run the following code snippets in C# to see how our library works. Also feel free to check out the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aspose-words/Aspose.Words-for-.NET) for other common use cases.

### Create a DOCX using C#

Aspose.Words for .NET allows you to create a blank Word document and add content to the file.

```c#
// Create a Word document.
Document doc = new Document();

// Use a DocumentBuilder instance to add content to the file.
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

// Write a new paragraph to the document.
builder.Writeln("This is an example of a Word document created in C#");

// Save it as a DOCX file. The output format is automatically determined by the filename extension.
doc.Save("OutputWordDocument.docx");
```

### Create a PDF in C#

Aspose.Words for .NET allows you to create a new PDF file and fill it with data.

```c#
// Create a PDF document.
Document pdf = new Document();

// Use a DocumentBuilder instance to add content to the file.
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(pdf);

// Write a new paragraph to the document.
builder.Writeln("This is an example of a PDF document created using C#");

// Save it as a PDF file.
pdf.Save("OutputDocument.pdf");
```

### Convert a Word document to HTML with C#

You can convert Microsoft Word to PDF, XPS, Markdown, HTML, JPEG, TIFF, and other file formats. The following snippet demonstrates the conversion from DOCX to HTML:

```c#
// Load a Word file from the local drive.
Document doc = new Document("InputWordDocument.docx");

// Save it to HTML format.
doc.Save("OutputHtmlDocument.html");
```

### Import a PDF and save as a DOCX via C#

In addition, you can import a PDF file into your .NET application and export it as a DOCX format file without the need to install Microsoft Word:

```c#
// Load a PDF file from the local drive.
Document pdf = new Document("InputDocument.pdf");

// Save it to DOCX format.
pdf.Save("OutputWordDocument.docx");
```

### Generate a summary of the document(s) using your preferred AI model, such as OpenAI, Google models, or any custom local language model.

```c#
Document firstDoc = new Document("DocumentA.docx");
Document secondDoc = new Document("DocumentB.docx");

// Use OpenAI or Google generative language models.
AiModel model = AiModel.Create(AiModelType.Gpt4OMini).WithApiKey(apiKey);

Document summary = model.Summarize(firstDoc, new SummarizeOptions() { SummaryLength = SummaryLength.Short });
summary.Save("SummaryA.docx");

Document multiSummary = model.Summarize(new Document[] { firstDoc, secondDoc }, new SummarizeOptions() { SummaryLength = SummaryLength.Long });
multiSummary.Save("SummaryA+B.docx");
```
### Translate the document using your preferred AI model, such as OpenAI, Google models, or any custom local language model.
```c#
Document doc = new Document("Document.docx");

// Use Google generative language models.
AiModel model = AiModel.Create(AiModelType.GeminiProLatest).WithApiKey(apiKey);

Document translatedDoc = model.Translate(doc, Language.Arabic);
translatedDoc.Save("AiTranslated.docx");
```
