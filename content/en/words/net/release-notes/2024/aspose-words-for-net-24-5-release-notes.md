## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 24.5. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added ability to create combo charts and set gap width, overlap and bubble scale properties of series group

Related issue: WORDSNET-19242

An ability to create combo charts, that is, charts consisting of several series groups, has been implemented. In addition, it has become possible to set the bubble scale, gap width and column overlap.

New classes **ChartSeriesGroup** and **ChartSeriesGroupCollection** have been implemented, and new **SeriesGroups** property have been added to the **Chart** class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Represents properties of a chart series group, that is, the properties of chart series of the same type
/// associated with the same axes.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Combo charts contains multiple chart series groups, with a separate group for each series type.
/// Also, you can create a chart series group to assign secondary axes to one or more chart series.
/// </remarks>
public class ChartSeriesGroup
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets the type of chart series included in this group.
    /// </summary>
    public ChartSeriesType SeriesType { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the axis group to which this series group belongs.
    /// </summary>
    public AxisGroup AxisGroup { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Provides access to properties of the X axis of this series group.
    /// </summary>
    public ChartAxis AxisX { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Provides access to properties of the Y axis of this series group.
    /// </summary>
    public ChartAxis AxisY { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets a collection of series that belong to this series group.
    /// </summary>
    public ChartSeriesCollection Series { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the percentage of how much the series bars or columns overlap.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Applies to series groups of all bar and column types.
    /// The range of acceptable values is from -100 to 100 inclusive. A value of 0 indicates that there is no
    /// space between bars/columns. If the value is -100, the distance between bars/columns is equal to their width.
    /// A value of 100 means that the bars/columns overlap completely.
    /// </remarks>
    public int Overlap { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the percentage of gap width between chart elements.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Applies only to series groups of the bar, column, pie-of-bar, pie-of-pie, histogram, box&whisker,
    /// waterfall and funnel types.
    /// The range of acceptable values is from 0 to 500 inclusive. For bar/column-based series groups, the
    /// property represents the space between bar clusters as a percentage of their width. For pie-of-pie and
    /// bar-of-pie charts, this is the space between the primary and secondary sections of the chart.
    /// </remarks>
    public int GapWidth { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the size of the bubbles as a percentage of their default size.

    /// Applies only to series groups of the <see cref="ChartSeriesType.Bubble"/> and
    /// <see cref="ChartSeriesType.Bubble3D"/> types.
    /// The range of acceptable values is from 0 to 300 inclusive.
    /// </remarks>
    public int BubbleScale { get; set; }
}

/// <summary>
/// Represents a type of a chart axis group.
/// </summary>
public enum AxisGroup
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Specifies the primary axis group.
    /// </summary>
    Primary,

    /// <summary>
    /// Specifies the secondary axis group.
    /// </summary>
    Secondary
}

/// <summary>
/// Represents a collection of <see cref="ChartSeriesGroup"/> objects.
/// </summary>
public class ChartSeriesGroupCollection : IEnumerable<ChartSeriesGroup>
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Adds a new series group of the specified series type to this collection.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Combo charts can contain series groups only of the following types: area, bar, column, line, pie, scatter,

    public ChartSeriesGroup Add(ChartSeriesType seriesType);

    /// <summary>
    /// Removes a series group at the specified index. All child series will be removed from the chart.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// You cannot remove all series groups. A chart must have at least one series group.
    /// </remarks>
    public void RemoveAt(int index);

    /// <summary>
    /// Returns a <see cref="ChartSeriesGroup"/> at the specified index.
    /// </summary>
    public ChartSeriesGroup this[int index] { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Returns the number of series groups in this collection.
    /// </summary>
    public int Count { get; }
}

public class Chart
{
    ...
    /// <summary>
    /// Provides access to a series group collection of this chart.
    /// </summary>
    public ChartSeriesGroupCollection SeriesGroups { get; }
}

/// </summary>
public double Radius {get; set;}
{{< /highlight >}}

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>

/// That is, higher-resolution images are resampled down to the limit and lower-resolution images are exported as is.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// If the value of this property is zero, all raster images are exported without resampling.
/// </para>

/// </summary>
public string Name
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the raw value of the adjustment.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>

/// That is, no calculation takes place for an adjust value guide.
/// Instead, this guide specifies a parameter value that is used for calculations within the shape guides.
/// </remarks>
public int Value
{{< /highlight >}}

Added new public property to **Shape** class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>

/// </remarks>
/// <returns>List of page numbers has been considered as blank and removed.</returns>
public List<int> RemoveBlankPages()
{{< /highlight >}}

### Supported keeping of source numbering while inserting a document using LINQ Reporting Engine

Related issue: WORDSNET-26482

Starting from Aspose.Words 24.5, you can control how numbered lists are processed while inserting a document using LINQ Reporting Engine. By default, numbered lists from a template document are continued when their identifiers match those from a document being inserted. However, if numbering for content being inserted should be separated and kept as is, this can be done by applying a sourceNumbering switch as follows.

This use case explains how keep source numbering while inserting a document using LINQ Reporting Engine:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "6e4482e7434754c31c6f2f6e4bf48bb1" "sourse-list-numbering.cs" >}}

### Layout warnings related to tables changed

The logic for two layout warnings related to table layouts has been changed to match the current AW behavior. The changes were integrated as a part of WORDSNET-24989

- Cell spacing warning "Cell spacing is not supported. The table will be rendered without cell spacing." has been changed to "Cell spacing is not rendered for a table not supported by the new table layout logic.". The warning is only issued when cell spacing is not actually rendered as it is currently rendered for most of the tables, apart from a few cases.

- Autofit table warning "Table column widths may need to be calculated. Rendered column widths could differ." has been changed to "A table not supported by the new table layout logic is encountered. Older logic that has known issues is applied." as table column widths are now always re-calculated for tables supported by the new table layout logic. The warning is only issued for top-level tables not supported by the new logic which is a relatively minor proportion. The logic is not issued for tables nested in other tables, as there can be many nested tables and the whole set is either handled by the new logic or not, so a single warning for the top-level table should be sufficient.
