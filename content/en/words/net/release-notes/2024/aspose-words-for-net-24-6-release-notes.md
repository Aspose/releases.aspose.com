## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 24.6. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added ability to create Treemap, Sunburst, Histogram, Pareto, Box & Whisker, Waterfall and Funnel charts

Related issue: WORDSNET-23967

An ability to create **Treemap**, **Sunburst**, **Histogram**, **Pareto**, **Box** & **Whisker**, **Waterfall** and **Funnel** charts has been implemented. The corresponding items are added to the **ChartType** enumeration type. Additional methods are provided in the **ChartSeriesCollection** class for creating series of the new chart types.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public enum ChartType
{
    ...

    /// <summary>
    /// Treemap chart.
    /// </summary>
    Treemap,

    /// <summary>
    /// Sunburst chart.
    /// </summary>
    Sunburst,

    /// <summary>
    /// Histogram chart.
    /// </summary>
    Histogram,

    /// <summary>
    /// Pareto chart.
    /// </summary>
    Pareto,

    /// <summary>
    /// Box and Whisker chart.
    /// </summary>
    BoxAndWhisker,

    /// <summary>
    /// Waterfall chart.
    /// </summary>
    Waterfall,

    /// <summary>
    /// Funnel chart.
    /// </summary>
    Funnel
}

public class ChartSeriesCollection
{
    ...

    /// <summary>
    /// Adds new <see cref="ChartSeries"/> to this collection.
    /// Use this method to add series that have multi-level data categories.
    /// </summary>
    /// <returns>Recently added <see cref="ChartSeries"/> object.</returns>
    public ChartSeries Add(string seriesName, ChartMultilevelValue[] categories, double[] values);

    /// <summary>
    /// Adds new <see cref="ChartSeries"/> to this collection.
    /// Use this method to add series to Histogram charts.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// For chart types other than Histogram, this method adds a series with empty Y values.
    /// </remarks>
    /// <returns>Recently added <see cref="ChartSeries"/> object.</returns>
    public ChartSeries Add(string seriesName, double[] xValues);

    /// <summary>
    /// Adds new <see cref="ChartSeries"/> to this collection.
    /// Use this method to add series to Waterfall charts.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// For chart types other than Waterfall, <paramref name="isSubtotal"/> values are ignored.
    /// </remarks>
    /// <param name="seriesName">A name of the series to be added.</param>
    /// <param name="categories">Category names for the X axis.</param>
    /// <param name="values">Y-axis values.</param>
    /// <param name="isSubtotal">Values indicating whether the corresponding Y value is a subtotal.</param>
    /// <returns>Recently added <see cref="ChartSeries"/> object.</returns>
    public ChartSeries Add(string seriesName, string[] categories, double[] values, bool[] isSubtotal);
}

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "65919861586e42e24f61a3ccb65f8f4e" "waterfall-chart.cs" >}}

### Added an ability to get a color of ShapeBase.ShadowFormat

Related issue: WORDSNET-26555

Implemented new public property in Aspose.Words.Drawing.ShadowFormat class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets a <see cref="System.Drawing.Color"/> object that represents the color for the shadow.
/// The default value is <see cref="System.Drawing.Color.Black"/>.
/// </summary>
public Color Color {get;}
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how get ShadowFormat color:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "65919861586e42e24f61a3ccb65f8f4e" "shadow-format-color.cs" >}}

### Added new comparison option IgnoreStoreItemId and advanced comparison option redesing

Related feature: WORDSNET-26971

New **AdvancedCompareOptions** class has beend added, new **AdvancedCompareOptions.IgnoreStoreItemId** option property has been added and option **IgnoreUniqueDmlId** property previously located in **CompareOptions** class has been moved to the newly created **AdvancedCompareOptions** class.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Allows to set advanced compare options.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// These options have no equivalence in Microsoft Word and might help to produce more precise comparison result.
/// </remarks>
public class AdvancedCompareOptions
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Specifies whether to ignore difference in DrawingML unique Id.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Default value is <c>false</c>.
    /// </remarks>
    public bool IgnoreDmlUniqueId { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Specifies whether to ignore difference in StructuredDocumentTag store item Id.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Default value is <c>false</c>.
    /// </remarks>
    public bool IgnoreStoreItemId { get; set; }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

New **IgnoreStoreItemId** option allows to control case when content of **StructuredDocumentTag** being compared is the same but **StructuredDocumentTags** itself have a difference in internal details, in this case this is **StructuredDocumentTag.XmlMapping.StoreItemId** difference.

Microsoft Word considers these SDTs to be different for any reason and this might confuse customers because they see that equal content is marked with edit revisions. By default we mimic MS Word here and this option allows to control the logic and produce more logical and readable comparison result.

Additionally we decided to extract all these experimental options into separate **AdvancedCompareOptions** class to avoid having mess. All options that have no equivalence in Microsoft Word will be published in **AdvancedCompareOptions** class. Thats why **IgnoreDmlUniqueId** property previously located in **CompareOptions** class was also moved into **AdvancedCompareOptions** class.

This use case explains how to use AdvancedCompareOptions:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "65919861586e42e24f61a3ccb65f8f4e" "ignore-store-item-id.cs" >}}

### Added public property Comment.DateTimeUtc

Related issue: WORDSNET-26923

An ability to get comment UTC datetime has been implemented. If a comment does not contain such information, a value of the Comment.DateTime property converted to UTC time is returned.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
public class Comment
{
    ...

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets the UTC date and time that the comment was made.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// The default value is DateTime.MinValue.
    /// </remarks>
    public DateTime DateTimeUtc { get; }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to get comment UTC datetime:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "65919861586e42e24f61a3ccb65f8f4e" "utc-date-time.cs" >}}

### Supported selective removal of paragraphs becoming empty for LINQ Reporting Engine

Related issue: WORDSNET-26515

In addition to removal of all paragraphs becoming empty after template syntax tags are processed, LINQ Reporting Engine introduces an ability to remove such paragraphs selectively using the following template syntax:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
<<!tag_name ...>>
{{< /highlight >}}

For a tag with its name prepended with an exclamation mark, the engine checks whether a corresponding paragraph or paragraphs become empty after the tag is processed, and if they do, removes them. Paragraphs corresponding to the rest of tags are kept intact by the engine.

This use case explains how to remove empty paragraphs selectively:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "65919861586e42e24f61a3ccb65f8f4e" "remove-paragraphs-selectively.cs" >}}

### Added an ability to specify a message for missing object members for LINQ Reporting Engine

Related issue: WORDSNET-26749

Starting from Aspose.Words 24.6, you can specify a message to be printed instead of a template expression that represents a plain reference to a missing member of an object when using LINQ Reporting Engine. The following code snippet shows how to achieve this.

Consider the following template example.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
Prefix <<[missing]>> suffix.
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to specify a message to be printed instead of a template expression that represents a plain reference to a missing member:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "65919861586e42e24f61a3ccb65f8f4e" "missing-members.cs" >}}
