## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 24.4. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added an ability to work with Glow effect of a shape

Related issue: WORDSNET-26670

Implemented new public class in **Aspose.Words.Drawing** namespace:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Represents the glow formatting for an object.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <p>Use the <see cref="ShapeBase.Glow"/> property to access glow properties of an object.
/// You do not create instances of the <see cref="GlowFormat"/> class directly.</p>
/// </remarks>
public class GlowFormat
{{< /highlight >}}

with new public members:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Removes <see cref="GlowFormat"/> from the parent object.
/// </summary>
public void Remove()
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a <see cref="System.Drawing.Color"/> object that represents the color for a glow effect.
/// The default value is <see cref="System.Drawing.Color.Black"/>.
/// </summary>
public Color Color {get; set}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the degree of transparency for the glow effect as a value between 0.0 (opaque) and 1.0 (clear).
/// The default value is 0.0.
/// </summary>
public double Transparency {get; set}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a double value that represents the length of the radius for a glow effect in points (pt).
/// The default value is 0.0.
/// </summary>
public double Radius {get; set}
{{< /highlight >}}

Also added new public property to **ShapeBase** class:

/// <summary>
/// Gets glow formatting for the shape.
/// </summary>
public GlowFormat Glow {get;}
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to work with the glow of a shape:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "5f20ac02cb42c6b08481aa1c5b0cd3db" "glow.cs" >}}

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <p>Use the <see cref="ShapeBase.Reflection"/> property to access reflection properties of an object.
/// You do not create instances of the <see cref="ReflectionFormat"/> class directly.</p>
/// </remarks>
public class ReflectionFormat
{{< /highlight >}}

with new public members:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Removes <see cref="ReflectionFormat"/> from the parent object.
/// </summary>
public void Remove()
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a double value that specifies the degree of blur effect applied to the reflection effect in points.
/// The default value is 0.0.
/// </summary>
public double Blur {get; set}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a double value that specifies the amount of separation of the reflected image from the object in points.
/// The default value is 0.0.
/// </summary>
public double Distance {get; set}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a double value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the size of the reflection
/// as a percentage of the reflected object.
/// The default value is 0.0.
/// </summary>
public double Size {get; set}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a double value between 0.0 (opaque) and 1.0 (clear) representing the degree
/// of transparency for the reflection effect.
/// The default value is 0.0.
/// </summary>
public double Transparency {get; set}
{{< /highlight >}}

Also added new public property to ShapeBase class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}

### Added a public property setter for Style.LinkedStyleName

Related issue: WORDSNET-24691

A public property setter for LinkedStyleName has been added to Style class:

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>It is only allowed to link the paragraph style to the character style and vice versa.</para>
/// <para>Setting LinkedStyleName for the current style automatically leads to setting LinkedStyleName for the linked style.</para>
/// <para>Assigning the empty string is equivalent to unlinking the previously linked style.</para>
/// </remarks>
public string LinkedStyleName { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

/// <summary>
/// Indicates the format in which the document is saved.
/// </summary>
public enum SaveFormat
{
    ...,

Related issue: WORDSNET-26569

Public **Format** properties of the **ChartFormat** type have been added to the **Chart**, **ChartTitle**, **ChartAxisTitle** and **ChartLegend** classes.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
public class Chart
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Provides access to fill and line formatting of the chart.
    /// </summary>
    public ChartFormat Format { get; }

    ...
}

public class ChartTitle
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Provides access to fill and line formatting of the chart title.
    /// </summary>
    public ChartFormat Format { get; }

    /// Provides access to fill and line formatting of the legend.
    /// </summary>
    public ChartFormat Format { get; }

    ...
}
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to set background color for chart, chart title, axis title and legend:

### Added public property HtmlLoadOptions.SupportFontFaceRules

Related issue: WORDSNET-8059

A new public property **SupportFontFaceRules** has been added to class **HtmlLoadOptions**:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a value indicating whether to support @font-face rules and whether to load declared fonts.
/// Default value is <c>false</c>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// If this option is enabled, fonts declared in @font-face rules are loaded and embedded into the resulting document's
/// font definitions (see <see cref="DocumentBase.FontInfos"/>). This makes the loaded fonts available for rendering but
/// doesn't automatically enable embedding of the fonts upon saving. In order to save the document with loaded fonts,
/// the <see cref="FontInfoCollection.EmbedTrueTypeFonts"/> property of the <see cref="DocumentBase.FontInfos"/>
/// collection should be set to <c>true</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Supported font formats are TTF, EOT, and WOFF.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// @font-face rules are not supported when loading SVG images.
/// </para>
/// </remarks>
public bool SupportFontFaceRules { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to use **SupportFontFaceRules** option:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "5f20ac02cb42c6b08481aa1c5b0cd3db" "font-face-rules.cs" >}}

### Added public property ParagraphFormat.MirrorIndents

Related issue: WORDSNET-26172

{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to use **MirrorIndents**:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "5f20ac02cb42c6b08481aa1c5b0cd3db" "mirror-indents.cs" >}}

### Provided sign document option in SaveOptions

Related issue: WORDSNET-25896

Implemented new public class in **Aspose.Words.Saving** namespace:

/// </summary>
public class DigitalSignatureDetails
{{< /highlight >}}

with new public members:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Initializes a new instance of <see cref="DigitalSignatureDetails"/> class.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="certificateHolder">A certificate holder which contains the certificate itself.</param>
/// <param name="signOptions">Signature options to use for signing a document.</param>
public DigitalSignatureDetails(CertificateHolder certificateHolder, SignOptions signOptions)
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a <see cref="CertificateHolder"/> object that contains the certificate used to sign a document.
