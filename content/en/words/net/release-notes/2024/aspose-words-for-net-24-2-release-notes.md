## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 24.2. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### <span style="color: #0593cb;">Added an ability to preserve empty lines while loading Markdown files.</span>

Related issue: WORDSNET-26064

Implemented new public classes with a new public property:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Allows to specify additional options when loading <see cref="LoadFormat.Markdown"/> document into a <see cref="Document"/> object.
/// </summary>
public class MarkdownLoadOptions : LoadOptions
...
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a boolean value indicating whether to preserve empty lines while load a <see cref="LoadFormat.Markdown"/> document.
/// The default value is <c>false</c>.
/// <para>
/// Normally, empty lines between block-level elements in Markdown are ignored. Empty lines at the beginning and
/// end of the document are also ignored. This option allows to import such empty lines.
/// </para>
/// </summary>
public bool PreserveEmptyLines { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to preserve empty lines while loading Markdown document:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "a775441ecb396eea917a2717cb9e8f8f" "preserve-empty-lines.cs" >}}

### <span style="color: #0593cb;">Introduced new public properties for enhanced style management.</span>

Related issue: WORDSNET-23973 

A new public properties *Priority*, *UnhideWhenUsed* and *SemiHidden* has been added to class Style.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets/sets the integer value that represents the priority for sorting the styles in the Styles task pane.
/// </summary>
public int Priority { get; set; }

/// <summary>
/// Gets/sets whether the style used in the current document unhides from the Styles gallery and from the Styles task pane.
/// </summary>
public bool UnhideWhenUsed { get; set; }

/// <summary>
/// Gets/sets whether the style hides from the Styles gallery and from the Styles task pane.
/// </summary>
public bool SemiHidden { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to work with new properties:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "a775441ecb396eea917a2717cb9e8f8f" "style-priority.cs" >}}

### <span style="color: #0593cb;">Added NodeRendererBase.Save() methods that accept SvgSaveOptions.</span>

Related issue: WORDSNET-23355

New public methods has been added to class *NodeRendererBase* allowing to pass *SvgSaveOptions*:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Renders the shape into an SVG image and saves into a file.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="fileName">The name for the image file. If a file with the specified name already exists, the existing file is overwritten.</param>
/// <param name="saveOptions">Specifies the options that control how the shape is rendered and saved. Can be <c>null</c>.</param>
public void Save(String fileName, SvgSaveOptions saveOptions);

/// <summary>
/// Renders the shape into an SVG image and saves into a stream.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="stream">The stream where to save the SVG image of the shape.</param>
/// <param name="saveOptions">Specifies the options that control how the shape is rendered and saved. Can be <c>null</c>.
/// If this is <c>null</c>, the image will be saved with the default options.</param>
public void Save(Stream stream, SvgSaveOptions saveOptions);
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to specify *SvgSaveOptions* when rendering via *ShapeRenderer.Save()* and *OfficeMathRenderer.Save()* methods:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "a775441ecb396eea917a2717cb9e8f8f" "save-office-math.cs" >}}

### <span style="color: #0593cb;">Added public property Appearance to the StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart class.</span>

Related issue: WORDSNET-26434

A new public property *Appearance* has been added to class *StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart* and *IStructuredDocumentTag* interface:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the appearance of the structured document tag.
/// </summary>
public SdtAppearance Appearance { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to get and set *Appearance* property of a ranged structured document tag:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "a775441ecb396eea917a2717cb9e8f8f" "appearance.cs" >}}


### <span style="color: #0593cb;">Added public property Footnote.ActualReferenceMark and public method Document.UpdateActualReferenceMarks.</span>

Related issue: WORDSNET-24512

An ability to get the actual text of reference marks for footnotes and endnotes has been implemented.

The following new public members have been added to the Footnote and Document classes:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
public class Footnote
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets the actual text of the reference mark displayed in the document for this footnote.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// To initially populate values of this property for all reference marks of the document, or to update
    /// the values after changes in the document that might affect the reference marks, you must execute the
    /// <see cref="Document.UpdateActualReferenceMarks"/> method.
    /// Updating fields (<see cref="Document.UpdateFields"/>) may also be necessary to get the correct result.
    /// </remarks>
    public string ActualReferenceMark { get; }
    ...
}

public class Document
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Updates the <see cref="Footnote.ActualReferenceMark"/> property of all footnotes and endnotes in the document.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Updating fields (<see cref="Document.UpdateFields"/>) may be necessary to get the correct result.
    /// </remarks>
    public void UpdateActualReferenceMarks();

    ...
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Also the ability to set font formatting for tick mark labels has been implemented: a new *AxisTickLabels.Font* property has been added.

And a *Format* property, which allows defining line formatting for an axis and fill for tick mark labels, has been added to the *ChartAxis* class.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
