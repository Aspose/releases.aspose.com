## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 24.3. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### <span style="color: #0593cb;">Updated Rendering Core for TIFF Image Format.</span>

Related issue: WORDSNET-26554

The rendering core for TIFF images has been upgraded, improving its functionality and performance. This update adds support for reading TIFF images with JPEG and Old JPEG compression types, and substantially improves the quality of both reading and writing operations.

Please note that while significant enhancements have been made, there are still some technical limitations. Some TIFF files with high bits per pixel (bpp) may not be fully supported.

This use case explains how use different TiffCompression types:

### <span style="color: #0593cb;">HtmlSaveOptions.Encoding save option no longer has any effect on MOBI/AZW3 export.</span>

Now for MOBI/AZW3 export HtmlSaveOptions.Encoding save option always has default value and MOBI and AZW3 documents are always saved with UTF-8 (without BOM) encoding.
