- Null reference error when saving a document.
- Loading DOC with CoordSize zero throws exception 
- 'Not expected other image formats here.' exception during Wml2Doc conversion.
- Saving WordML document that has hyperlinks but has no Document.BaseUri throws
- Local path is escaped incorrectly when exporting to WML 
- Support well-known color names in w:color elements 
- Import of hex character entities does not work 
- Export vertical text to HTML 
- Line breaks exported to HTML sometimes missing 
- Before and After spacing between paragraphs needs better handling
- A border shows around an image that does not have it originally. 
- Nested FloatingBox output to PDF XML 
- A paragraph that ends with a line break should take two lines, but takes only one in PDF 
- MailMerge takes formatting from field value run, whereas it should take it from field code run.
