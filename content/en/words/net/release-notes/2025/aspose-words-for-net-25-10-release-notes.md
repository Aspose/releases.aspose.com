## Major Features

There are 70 improvements and fixes in this regular monthly release. The most notable are:

- **Text Export:** Enhanced plain text conversion by adding the ability to export Office Math objects as [LaTeX expressions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.saving/txtsaveoptions/officemathexportmode/).
- **PDF Export:** Introduced a new [save option](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.saving/pdfsaveoptions/exportfloatingshapesasinlinetag/) for more precise control over the tagging of floating shapes as either inline or block-level elements.
- **Markdown Export:** Implemented a [resource-saving callback](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.saving/markdownsaveoptions/resourcesavingcallback/), providing developers with greater flexibility in managing how images and other resources are exported.
- **PDF/UA Export & Accessibility:** Improved compliance by correctly tagging horizontal rules as artifacts, enhancing the experience for users of assistive technologies.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 25.10. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added ability to export oMath (OOXML Math) as LaTex based expressions upon converting to Text.

Related issue: WORDSNET-28694

A new public property has been added to [Aspose.Words.Saving.TxtSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.saving/txtsaveoptions/) class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies how OfficeMath will be written to the output file.
/// Default value is <see cref="TxtOfficeMathExportMode.Text"/>.
/// </summary>
public TxtOfficeMathExportMode OfficeMathExportMode { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

and a corresponding enumeration into [Aspose.Words.Saving](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.saving/) namespace:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies how Aspose.Words exports OfficeMath to <see cref="SaveFormat.Text"/>.
/// </summary>
public enum TxtOfficeMathExportMode
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Export OfficeMath as plain text.
    /// </summary>
    Text = 0,

    /// <summary>
    /// Export OfficeMath as LaTeX.
    /// </summary>
    Latex = 3
}
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to export OfficeMath equations as Latex while saving document to Text:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "67ab3fcab43d41e5dc207060f8f5faba" "export-office-math-as-latex-to-text.cs" >}}

### Added new public option PdfSaveOptions.ExportFloatingShapesAsInlineTag.

Related issue: WORDSNET-28609

A new public option [ExportFloatingShapesAsInlineTag](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.saving/pdfsaveoptions/exportfloatingshapesasinlinetag/) has been added to [PdfSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.saving/pdfsaveoptions/) class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a value determining whether floating shapes are exported as inline tags in the document structure.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para> Default value is <c>false</c> and floating shapes will be exported as block-level tags,
/// placed after the paragraph in which they are anchored.</para>
/// <para> When the value is <c>true</c> floating shapes will be exported as inline tags,
/// placed within the paragraph where they are anchored.</para>
/// <para> This value is ignored when <see cref="ExportDocumentStructure"/> is <c>false</c>. </para>
/// </remarks>
public bool ExportFloatingShapesAsInlineTag { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to select between inline and block-level tag export for floating shapes:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "67ab3fcab43d41e5dc207060f8f5faba" "export-floating-shapes-as-inline-tag.cs" >}}

### Added support for IResourceSavingCallback to MarkdownSaveOptions class.

Related issue: WORDSNET-28557

A new public property has been added to [Aspose.Words.Saving.MarkdownSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.saving/markdownsaveoptions/) class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Allows to control how resources are saved when a document is exported to
/// <see cref="Aspose.Words.SaveFormat.Markdown"/> format.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Note, there is only one type of resources in Markdown. These are images.
/// When you specify both <see cref="ImageSavingCallback"/> and <see cref="ResourceSavingCallback"/>,
/// then first is called <see cref="ResourceSavingCallback"/>. However, note it is not necessary to have both
/// implementations, as <see cref="ImageSavingArgs"/> is actually a subset of <see cref="ResourceSavingArgs"/>.
/// </remarks>
public IResourceSavingCallback ResourceSavingCallback { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how change file URI while saving document to Markdown:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "67ab3fcab43d41e5dc207060f8f5faba" "markdown-resource-saving-callback.cs" >}}
