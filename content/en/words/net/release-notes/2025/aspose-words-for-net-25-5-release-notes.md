## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 25.5. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added ability to set chart style

Related issue: WORDSNET-27647

The [ChartStyle](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.drawing.charts/chartstyle/) enumeration type has been implemented to be able to set chart style:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies predefined styles of a chart.
/// </summary>
public enum ChartStyle
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Represents the default chart style.
    /// </summary>
    Normal,

    /// <summary>
    /// A style with muted colors.
    /// </summary>
    Muted,

    /// <summary>
    /// A style with more saturated colors.
    /// </summary>
    Saturated,

    /// <summary>
    /// A style with shaded data points.
    /// </summary>
    Shaded,

    /// <summary>
    /// A style with flat data points without gradient.
    /// </summary>
    Flat,

    /// <summary>
    /// A style with data points having a shadow.
    /// </summary>
    Shadowed,

    /// <summary>
    /// A style with gradient fill of data points.
    /// </summary>
    Gradient,

    /// <summary>
    /// A style with an original appearance of a chart.
    /// </summary>
    Original,

    /// <summary>
    /// A style with transparent data points.
    /// </summary>
    Transparent1,

    /// <summary>
    /// A style with transparent data points.
    /// </summary>
    Transparent2,

    /// <summary>
    /// A style with data points having no fill, but only an outline.
    /// </summary>
    Outline,

    /// <summary>
    /// A style with black chart background, in which data points have no fill, but only an outline.
    /// </summary>
    OutlineBlack,

    /// <summary>
    /// A style with black chart background.
    /// </summary>
    Black,

    /// <summary>
    /// A style with gray gradient chart background.
    /// </summary>
    Grey,

    /// <summary>
    /// A style with blue chart background.
    /// </summary>
    Blue,

    /// <summary>
    /// A style, in which the plot area is shaded.
    /// </summary>
    ShadedPlot
}
{{< /highlight >}}

You can specify a chart style when inserting a new chart into a document using the following new methods of the [DocumentBuilder](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/documentbuilder/) class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
public class DocumentBuilder
{
    ...
    /// <summary>
    /// Inserts an chart object into the document and scales it to the specified size.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="chartStyle">The style of the inserted chart.</param>
    public Shape InsertChart(ChartType chartType, double width, double height, ChartStyle chartStyle);

    /// <summary>
    /// Inserts an chart object into the document and scales it to the specified size.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="chartStyle">The style of the inserted chart.</param>
    public Shape InsertChart(
        ChartType chartType,
        RelativeHorizontalPosition horzPos,
        double left,
        RelativeVerticalPosition vertPos,
        double top,
        double width,
        double height,
        WrapType wrapType,
        ChartStyle chartStyle);
}
{{< /highlight >}}

The new property has been added to the Chart class to be able to set style of an existing chart:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
public class Chart
{
    ...
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the style of the chart.
    /// </summary>
    public ChartStyle Style { get; set; }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to set a specific chart style:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "ad73e0dd58a8c2ae742bb64f8561df35" "set-chart-style.cs" >}}

### Added possibility to control how empty paragraphs are exported into Markdown

Related issue: WORDSNET-28043

Implemented new public option in [Aspose.Words.Saving.MarkdownSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.saving/markdownsaveoptions/markdownsaveoptions/) class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies how to export empty paragraphs to Markdown.
/// Default value is <see cref="MarkdownEmptyParagraphExportMode.EmptyLine"/>.
/// </summary>
public MarkdownEmptyParagraphExportMode EmptyParagraphExportMode { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

And added new enumeration into [Aspose.Words.Saving](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.saving/) namespace:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies how Aspose.Words exports empty paragraphs to Markdown.
/// </summary>
public enum MarkdownEmptyParagraphExportMode
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to remove empty paragraphs from the Markdown output:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "ad73e0dd58a8c2ae742bb64f8561df35" "empty-paragraph-export-mode.cs" >}}
