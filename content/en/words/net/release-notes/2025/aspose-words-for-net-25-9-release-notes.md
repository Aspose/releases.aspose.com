## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 25.9. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Introduced a new RecoveryMode option for greater control when opening corrupted documents.

Related issue: WORDSNET-28560

A new public option [RecoveryMode](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.loading/loadoptions/recoverymode/) has been added to [LoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.loading/loadoptions/) class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Defines how the document should be handled if errors occur during loading.  
/// Use this property to specify whether the system should attempt to recover the document 
/// or follow another defined behavior.  
/// The default value is <see cref="DocumentRecoveryMode.TryRecover"/>. 
/// </summary>
public DocumentRecoveryMode RecoveryMode { get; set; }

/// <summary>
/// Specifies the available recovery options when a document encounters errors during loading.
/// </summary>
public enum DocumentRecoveryMode
{
    /// <summary>
    /// No recovery is attempted.  
    /// If the document is invalid, loading will fail with an error.
    /// </summary>
    None,

    /// <summary>
    /// Attempts to recover the document while preserving as much data as possible.
    /// </summary>
    TryRecover,
}
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to define the recovery mode behavior when loading a document:

### Enhanced control over shadow effects with the addition of new public properties.

Related issue: WORDSNET-28384

A new public properties [Color](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.drawing/shadowformat/color/) and [Transparency](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.drawing/shadowformat/transparency/) has been added to class [ShadowFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.drawing/shadowformat/).
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a <see cref="System.Drawing.Color"/> object that represents the color for the shadow.
/// The default value is <see cref="System.Drawing.Color.Black"/>.
/// </summary>
public Color Color { get; set; }

/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the degree of transparency for the shadow effect as a value between 0.0 (opaque) and 1.0 (clear).
/// The default value is 0.0.
/// </summary>
public double Transparency { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to work with Colors and Transparency:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "045648ef22da6b384ebcf0344717bfb5" "shadow-format-transparency.cs" >}}

### Added support for exporting mathematical equations (Office Math) to LaTeX expressions.

Related issue: WORDSNET-28492

A new public enumeration [MarkdownOfficeMathExportMode](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.saving/markdownsaveoptions/officemathexportmode/) has been added:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Export OfficeMath as LaTeX.
/// </summary>
Latex
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to export oMath as LaTex based expressions into Markdown:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "045648ef22da6b384ebcf0344717bfb5" "export-office-math-as-latex.cs" >}}

### Improved diagnostics by introducing typed warnings for font substitution, allowing for more robust error handling.

Related issue: WORDSNET-28356

New public class [FontSubstitutionWarningInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/fontsubstitutionwarninginfo/) and [FontSubstitutionReason](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/fontsubstitutionwarninginfo/reason/) enum were added.

FontSubstitutionWarningInfo contains additional information about font substitution.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Contains information about a font substitution warning that Aspose.Words issued during document loading or saving.
/// </summary>
public class FontSubstitutionWarningInfo : WarningInfo
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Font substitution reason.
    /// </summary>
    public FontSubstitutionReason Reason { get; }
    /// <summary>
    /// Requested font family name.
    /// </summary>
    public string RequestedFamilyName { get; }
    /// <summary>
    /// Indicates whether bold style was requested.
    /// </summary>
    public bool RequestedBold { get; }
    /// <summary>
    /// Indicates whether italic style was requested.
    /// </summary>
    public bool RequestedItalic { get; }
    /// <summary>
    /// Resolved font.
    /// </summary>
    public PhysicalFontInfo ResolvedFont { get; }
}

/// <summary>
/// Specifies the reason of font substitution.
/// </summary>
public enum FontSubstitutionReason
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Font substitution by alternative name from the document.
    /// </summary>
    AlternativeName,
    /// <summary>
    /// Font substitution by font name rule.
    /// </summary>
    FontNameSubstitutionRule,
    /// <summary>
    /// Font substitution by font config rule.
    /// </summary>
    FontConfigSubstitutionRule,
    /// <summary>
    /// Font substitution by table rule.
    /// </summary>
    TableSubstitutionRule,
    /// <summary>
    /// Font substitution by font info rule.
    /// </summary>
    FontInfoSubstitutionRule,
    /// <summary>
    /// Font substitution by default font rule.
    /// </summary>
    DefaultFontSubstitutionRule,
    /// <summary>
    /// Font substitution with the first available font.
    /// </summary>
    FirstAvailableFont
}
