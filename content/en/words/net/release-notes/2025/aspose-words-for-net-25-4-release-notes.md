## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 25.4. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### New public paper sizes JisB4 and JisB5 have been added

Related issue: WORDSNET-27516 

New public paper sizes JisB4 and JisB5 have been added to [PaperSize](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/papersize/) enum:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// 257 x 364 mm.
/// </summary>
JisB4,
/// <summary>
/// 182 x 257 mm.
/// </summary>
JisB5
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how use new paper sizes:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "12a3a3cfe30f3145220db88428a9f814" "jisb-paper-size.cs" >}}

### Added new public option HtmlSaveOptions.RemoveJavaScriptFromLinks

Related issue: WORDSNET-27851

A new public option RemoveJavaScriptFromLinks has been added in HtmlSaveOptions class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies whether JavaScript will be removed from links.
/// Default is <c>false</c>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// If this option is enabled, all links containing JavaScript (e.g., links with "javascript:" in the href attribute)
/// will be replaced with "javascript:void(0)". This can help prevent potential security risks, such as XSS attacks.
/// </remarks>
public bool RemoveJavaScriptFromLinks { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case shows how to specify whether JavaScript will be removed from links:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "12a3a3cfe30f3145220db88428a9f814" "html-remove-java-script-from-links.cs" >}}

### Added a new overload for Watermark.SetImage with Stream as parameter

Related issue: WORDSNET-27938

The following new overload of Watermark.SetImage has been implemented:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Adds Image watermark into the document.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="imageStream">The stream containing the image data that is displayed as a watermark.</param>
/// <param name="options">Defines additional options for the image watermark.</param>
/// <exception cref="ArgumentNullException">
/// Throws when the path is <c>null</c>.
/// </exception>
/// <remarks>If <see cref="ImageWatermarkOptions"/> is <c>null</c>, the watermark will be set with default options.</remarks>
public void SetImage(Stream imageStream, ImageWatermarkOptions options)
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case shows how to add Image watermark into the document using stream containing the image data:
