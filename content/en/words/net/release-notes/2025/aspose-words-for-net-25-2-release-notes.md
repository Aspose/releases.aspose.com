/// <summary>
/// Creates a new single level list based on the predefined template and adds it to the list collection in the document.
/// </summary>
public List AddSingleLevelList(ListTemplate listTemplate)
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to work with AddSingleLevelList() method:
