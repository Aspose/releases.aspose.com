This page contains release notes for [Aspose.Words Reporting Services 1.0.4.0 Hot Fix](https://releases.aspose.com/words/reportingservices/new-releases/aspose.words-reporting-services-1.0.4.0-hot-fix/)

{{% /alert %}}

This release addresses several minor issues reported by customers. In particular, rendering of complex nested subreports was improved. Nested subreports containing tables often result in a deep hierarchy of nested tables in Microsoft Word documents. Starting with v1.0.4, the tables are "really" nested (containing each other) which fixes the layout and simplifies editing - for example, inner (child) tables are moved together with the outer (parent) table when positioning it in the document.
