This page contains release notes for [Aspose.Words for Reporting Services 1.4.1.0](https://releases.aspose.com/words/reportingservices/new-releases/aspose.words-for-reporting-services-1.4.1.0/)

{{% /alert %}}

This release introduces a very interesting feature. Now you can enable a special mode that will instruct the renderer to understand HTML text hosted within textboxes! This allows to apply different inline formatting such as or italic within the same textbox. Moreover, you can insert almost any HTML you wish! Of course, this feature won't work in design time as well as in the formats exported by rendering extensions other than Aspose.Words for Reporting Services. However, if you want to export rich formatted reports to Microsoft Word documents, this new feature is exactly what you need.

- Added the EnableHTMLFormatting configuration option.
  Configuration options can now be enclosed directly into the &lt;Configuration&gt; element rather than into the &lt;DeviceInfo&gt; element. For backward compatibility purposes both methods are supported.
