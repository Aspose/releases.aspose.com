We keep improving rendering RDL reports to fully editable Microsoft Word documents. This release is another stage of this continuous process. The release includes a number of fixes applied while testing existing customer reports, therefore not registered in our defect database. So there are no defect numbers to list this time. Simply download the program and try it, and please report anything that you think should be fixed or improved.

- Exposed the OverlapResolutionMethod configuration option.
- Fixed a number of bugs and issues noticed when working on rendering existing customer reports.
