{{% /alert %}}

Please welcome a new release of Aspose.Words for Reporting Services. Most of the changes and improvements applied in this version have to do with supporting Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 (SSRS 2008 R2) released this year. Also we have improved the support of some core SSRS 2008 report items such as Tablix and added the support for the Gauge report item.

- Support of Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 Reporting Services.
- Added support of the Gauge report item.
- Tablix layout was incorrect in some exported reports.
- Headers/footers were sometimes printed incorrectly.
- Minor fixes and improvements.
