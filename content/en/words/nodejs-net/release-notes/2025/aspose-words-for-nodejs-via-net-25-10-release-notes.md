## Major Features

There are 65 improvements and fixes in this regular monthly release. The most notable are:

- **Text Export:** Enhanced plain text conversion by adding the ability to export Office Math objects as [LaTeX expressions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.saving/txtsaveoptions/officemathexportmode/).
- **PDF Export:** Introduced a new [save option](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.saving/pdfsaveoptions/exportfloatingshapesasinlinetag/) for more precise control over the tagging of floating shapes as either inline or block-level elements.
- **Markdown Export:** Implemented a [resource-saving callback](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.saving/markdownsaveoptions/resourcesavingcallback/), providing developers with greater flexibility in managing how images and other resources are exported.
- **PDF/UA Export & Accessibility:** Improved compliance by correctly tagging horizontal rules as artifacts, enhancing the experience for users of assistive technologies.
