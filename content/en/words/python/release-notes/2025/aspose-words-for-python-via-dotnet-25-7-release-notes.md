## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words for Python via .NET 25.7. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words for Python via .NET which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added the Row.hidden public property, enabling the ability to programmatically show or hide specific rows within a table.

A new public property [hidden](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.tables/row/hidden/) has been added in [Row](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.tables/row/) class:

This use case explains how to programmatically show or hide specific rows within a table:
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "67c1d01ce69d189983b497fd497a7768" "hidden-row.cs" >}}
{{< highlight csharp >}}
doc = aw.Document(file_name=MY_DIR + 'Tables.docx')
row = doc.first_section.body.tables[0].first_row
row.hidden = True
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Table.HiddenRow.docx')
doc = aw.Document(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Table.HiddenRow.docx')
row = doc.first_section.body.tables[0].first_row
self.assertTrue(row.hidden)
for cell in row.cells:
    cell = cell.as_cell()
    for para in cell.paragraphs:
        para = para.as_paragraph()
        for run in para.runs:
            run = run.as_run()
            self.assertTrue(run.font.hidden)
{{< /highlight >}}`
### First version of OpenType Font Variation support.

First version of OpenType Font Variation support has been released. Now variable font named instances are correctly laid-out both with and without HarfBuzz shaping and correctly embedded into PDF and XPS.

Limitations:
- Limited support when rendering to fixed page formats other than PDF and XPS
- Not supported glyph outlines retrieval (used in cases like WordArt text effects and 3D text effects).

Also OpenType Font Variation support affects font search cache export/import. In order for font variations to work properly, the cache should be generated in the new Aspose.Words version.

### Removed obsolete PdfSaveOptions.embed_attachments property.

Obsolete property PdfSaveOptions.embed_attachments has been removed. 
[PdfSaveOptions.attachments_embedding_mode](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pdfsaveoptions/attachmentsembeddingmode/) should be used instead.
