## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words for Python via .NET 25.4. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words for Python via .NET which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### New public paper sizes JisB4 and JisB5 have been added

New public paper sizes JisB4 and JisB5 have been added to [PaperSize](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/papersize/) enum:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document(file_name=MY_DIR + 'Big document.docx')
page_setup = doc.first_section.page_setup
# Set the paper size to JisB4 (257x364mm).
page_setup.paper_size = aw.PaperSize.JIS_B4
# Alternatively, set the paper size to JisB5. (182x257mm).
page_setup.paper_size = aw.PaperSize.JIS_B5
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new public option HtmlSaveOptions.remove_java_script_from_links

A new public option remove_java_script_from_links has been added in HtmlSaveOptions class.

This use case shows how to specify whether JavaScript will be removed from links:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document(file_name=MY_DIR + 'JavaScript in HREF.docx')
save_options = aw.saving.HtmlSaveOptions()
save_options.remove_java_script_from_links = True
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'HtmlSaveOptions.RemoveJavaScriptFromLinks.html', save_options=save_options)
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added a new overload for Watermark.SetImage with Stream as parameter

The new overload of Watermark.set_image has been implemented.

This use case shows how to add Image watermark into the document using stream containing the image data:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document()
# Modify the image watermark's appearance with an ImageWatermarkOptions object,
# then pass it while creating a watermark from an image file.
image_watermark_options = aw.ImageWatermarkOptions()
image_watermark_options.scale = 5
with system_helper.io.FileStream(IMAGE_DIR + 'Logo.jpg', system_helper.io.FileMode.OPEN, system_helper.io.FileAccess.READ) as image_stream:
    doc.watermark.set_image(image_stream=image_stream, options=image_watermark_options)
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Document.ImageWatermarkStream.docx')
