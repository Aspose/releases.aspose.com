## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words for Python via .NET 25.5. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words for Python via .NET which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added ability to set chart style

The [ChartStyle](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.drawing.charts/chartstyle/) enumeration type has been implemented to be able to set chart style.
You can specify a chart style when inserting a new chart into a document using the following new **insert_chart** methods of the [DocumentBuilder](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/documentbuilder/) class.
The new property **style** has been added to the Chart class to be able to set style of an existing chart.

This use case explains how to set a specific chart style:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc=doc)
# Insert a chart in the Black style.
builder.insert_chart(chart_type=aw.drawing.charts.ChartType.COLUMN, width=400, height=250, chart_style=aw.drawing.charts.ChartStyle.BLACK)
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Charts.SetChartStyle.docx')
doc = aw.Document(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Charts.SetChartStyle.docx')
# Get a chart to update.
shape = doc.get_child(aw.NodeType.SHAPE, 0, True).as_shape()
chart = shape.chart
# Get the chart style.
self.assertEqual(aw.drawing.charts.ChartStyle.BLACK, chart.style)
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added possibility to control how empty paragraphs are exported into Markdown

Implemented new **empty_paragraph_export_mode** public option in [Aspose.Words.Saving.MarkdownSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/markdownsaveoptions/markdownsaveoptions/) class.
And added new **MarkdownEmptyParagraphExportMode** enumeration into [Aspose.Words.Saving](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/) namespace.

This use case explains how to remove empty paragraphs from the Markdown output:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc=doc)
builder.writeln('First')
builder.writeln('\r\n\r\n\r\n')
builder.writeln('Last')
save_options = aw.saving.MarkdownSaveOptions()
save_options.empty_paragraph_export_mode = export_mode
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'MarkdownSaveOptions.EmptyParagraphExportMode.md', save_options=save_options)
result = system_helper.io.File.read_all_text(ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'MarkdownSaveOptions.EmptyParagraphExportMode.md')
switch_condition = export_mode
if switch_condition == aw.saving.MarkdownEmptyParagraphExportMode.NONE:
    self.assertEqual('First\r\n\r\nLast\r\n', result)
elif switch_condition == aw.saving.MarkdownEmptyParagraphExportMode.EMPTY_LINE:
    self.assertEqual('First\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLast\r\n\r\n', result)
elif switch_condition == aw.saving.MarkdownEmptyParagraphExportMode.MARKDOWN_HARD_LINE_BREAK:
    self.assertEqual('First\r\n\\\r\n\\\r\n\\\r\n\\\r\n\\\r\nLast\r\n<br>\r\n', result)
{{< /highlight >}}
