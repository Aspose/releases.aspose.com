## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words for Python via .NET 25.10. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words for Python via .NET which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added ability to export oMath (OOXML Math) as LaTex based expressions upon converting to Text.

A new public property **office_math_export_mode** has been added to [Aspose.Words.Saving.TxtSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.saving/txtsaveoptions/) class,
and a **TxtOfficeMathExportMode** enumeration into [Aspose.Words.Saving](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.saving/) namespace.

This use case explains how to export OfficeMath equations as Latex while saving document to Text:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document(file_name=MY_DIR + 'Office math.docx')
save_options = aw.saving.TxtSaveOptions()
save_options.office_math_export_mode = aw.saving.TxtOfficeMathExportMode.LATEX
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'TxtSaveOptions.ExportOfficeMathAsLatexToText.txt', save_options=save_options)
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new public option PdfSaveOptions.export_floating_shapes_as_inline_tag.

A new public option [export_floating_shapes_as_inline_tag](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pdfsaveoptions/export_floating_shapes_as_inline_tag/) has been added to [PdfSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pdfsaveoptions/) class.

This use case explains how to select between inline and block-level tag export for floating shapes:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document(file_name=MY_DIR + 'Floating object.docx')
save_options = aw.saving.PdfSaveOptions()
save_options.export_floating_shapes_as_inline_tag = True
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'PdfSaveOptions.ExportFloatingShapesAsInlineTag.pdf', save_options=save_options)
{{< /highlight >}}
