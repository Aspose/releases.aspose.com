## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words for Python via .NET 25.9. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words for Python via .NET which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Introduced a new recovery_mode option for greater control when opening corrupted documents.

A new public option [RecoveryMode](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.loading/loadoptions/recoverymode/) has been added to [LoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.loading/loadoptions/) class.

This use case explains how to define the recovery mode behavior when loading a document:

{{< highlight python >}}
load_options = aw.loading.LoadOptions()
load_options.recovery_mode = aw.loading.DocumentRecoveryMode.TRY_RECOVER
doc = aw.Document(file_name=MY_DIR + 'Corrupted footnotes.docx', load_options=load_options)
{{< /highlight >}}

### Enhanced control over shadow effects with the addition of new public properties.

A new public properties [color](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.drawing/shadowformat/color/) and [transparency](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.drawing/shadowformat/transparency/) has been added to class [ShadowFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.drawing/shadowformat/).

This use case explains how to work with Colors and Transparency:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document(file_name=MY_DIR + 'Shadow color.docx')
shape = doc.get_child(aw.NodeType.SHAPE, 0, True).as_shape()
shadow_format = shape.shadow_format
shadow_format.type = aw.drawing.ShadowType.SHADOW21
shadow_format.color = aspose.pydrawing.Color.red
shadow_format.transparency = 0.8
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Shape.ShadowFormatTransparency.docx')
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added support for exporting mathematical equations (Office Math) to LaTeX expressions.

A new public enumeration **LATEX** has been added to [MarkdownOfficeMathExportMode](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/markdownsaveoptions/officemathexportmode/) has been added:

This use case explains how to export oMath as LaTex based expressions into Markdown:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document(file_name=MY_DIR + 'Office math.docx')
save_options = aw.saving.MarkdownSaveOptions()
save_options.office_math_export_mode = aw.saving.MarkdownOfficeMathExportMode.LATEX
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'MarkdownSaveOptions.ExportOfficeMathAsLatex.md', save_options=save_options)
