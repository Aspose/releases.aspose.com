## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words for Python via .NET 25.6. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words for Python via .NET which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added multi-page export to raster image formats (PNG/JPG/etc.) with customizable layouts (Horizontal/Vertical/Grid).

Introduced new **page_layout** public property in [Aspose.Words.Saving.ImageSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/imagesaveoptions/) class.

Added a new **MultiPageLayout** factory class to create the muli-page layout configurations in [Aspose.Words.Saving](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/) namespace.

This use case explains how to save a 5-page document into JPG image with multi-page layout settings:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document(file_name=MY_DIR + 'Rendering.docx')
options = aw.saving.ImageSaveOptions(aw.SaveFormat.JPEG)
# Set up a grid layout with:
# - 3 columns per row.
# - 10pts spacing between pages (horizontal and vertical).
options.page_layout = aw.saving.MultiPageLayout.grid(3, 10, 10)
# Alternative layouts:
# options.page_layout = aw.saving.MultiPageLayout.horizontal(10);
# options.page_layout = aw.saving.MultiPageLayout.vertical(10);
# Customize the background and border.
options.page_layout.back_color = aspose.pydrawing.Color.light_gray
options.page_layout.border_color = aspose.pydrawing.Color.blue
options.page_layout.border_width = 2
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'ImageSaveOptions.GridLayout.jpg', save_options=options)
