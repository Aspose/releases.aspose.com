## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words for Python via .NET 24.5. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words for Python via .NET which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added ability to create combo charts and set gap width, overlap and bubble scale properties of series group

An ability to create combo charts, that is, charts consisting of several series groups, has been implemented. In addition, it has become possible to set the bubble scale, gap width and column overlap.

New classes **ChartSeriesGroup** and **ChartSeriesGroupCollection** have been implemented, and new **series_groups** property have been added to the **Chart** class.

This use case explains how to create combo chart with secondary Y axis:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc)
shape = builder.insert_chart(chart_type=aw.drawing.charts.ChartType.LINE, width=450, height=250)
chart = shape.chart
series = chart.series
# Delete default generated series.
series.clear()
categories = ['Category 1', 'Category 2', 'Category 3']
series.add(series_name='Series 1 of primary series group', categories=categories, values=[2, 3, 4])
series.add(series_name='Series 2 of primary series group', categories=categories, values=[5, 2, 3])
# Create an additional series group, also of the line type.
new_series_group = chart.series_groups.add(aw.drawing.charts.ChartSeriesType.LINE)
# Specify the use of secondary axes for the new series group.
new_series_group.axis_group = aw.drawing.charts.AxisGroup.SECONDARY
# Hide the secondary X axis.
new_series_group.axis_x.hidden = True
# Define title of the secondary Y axis.
new_series_group.axis_y.title.show = True
new_series_group.axis_y.title.text = 'Secondary Y axis'
# Add a series to the new series group.
series3 = new_series_group.series.add(series_name='Series of secondary series group', categories=categories, values=[13, 11, 16])
series3.format.stroke.weight = 3.5
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Charts.SecondaryAxis.docx')
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to remove secondary axis:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document(file_name=MY_DIR + 'Combo chart.docx')
shape = doc.get_child(aw.NodeType.SHAPE, 0, True).as_shape()
chart = shape.chart
series_groups = chart.series_groups
# Find secondary axis and remove from the collection.
i = 0
while i < series_groups.count:
    if series_groups[i].axis_group == aw.drawing.charts.AxisGroup.SECONDARY:
        series_groups.remove_at(i)
    i += 1
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to configure gap overlap:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc)
shape = builder.insert_chart(chart_type=aw.drawing.charts.ChartType.COLUMN, width=450, height=250)
series_group = shape.chart.series_groups[0]
# Set column gap width and overlap.
series_group.gap_width = 450
series_group.overlap = -75
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Charts.ConfigureGapOverlap.docx')
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to set bubble scale to 200%:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc)
# Insert a bubble 3D chart.
shape = builder.insert_chart(chart_type=aw.drawing.charts.ChartType.BUBBLE_3D, width=450, height=250)
series_group = shape.chart.series_groups[0]
# Set bubble scale to 200%.
series_group.bubble_scale = 200
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Charts.BubbleScale.docx')
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added an ability to work with SoftEdge effect of a shape

New class **SoftEdgeFormat** have been implemented in **aspose.words.drawing** namespace, and new **SoftEdge** property have been added to the **ShapeBase** class.

This use case explains how to work with the soft edge effect of a shape:

{{< highlight python >}}
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder()
shape = builder.insert_shape(shape_type=aw.drawing.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, width=200, height=200)
# Apply soft edge to the shape.
shape.soft_edge.radius = 30
builder.document.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Shape.SoftEdge.docx')
# Load document with rectangle shape with soft edge.
doc = aw.Document(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Shape.SoftEdge.docx')
shape = doc.get_child(aw.NodeType.SHAPE, 0, True).as_shape()
# Check soft edge radius.
self.assertEqual(30, shape.soft_edge.radius)
# Remove soft edge from the shape.
shape.soft_edge.remove()
# Check radius of the removed soft edge.
self.assertEqual(0, shape.soft_edge.radius)
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added public property SvgSaveOptions.max_image_resolution

A new public property **max_image_resolution** has been added to class **SvgSaveOptions**:

This use case explains how to set a value in pixels per inch that limits resolution of exported raster images:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document(file_name=MY_DIR + 'Rendering.docx')
save_options = aw.saving.SvgSaveOptions()
save_options.max_image_resolution = 72
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'SvgSaveOptions.MaxImageResolution.svg', save_options=save_options)
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added support for shape adjust values

New class **AdjustmentCollection** and **Adjustment** have been implemented in **aspose.words.drawing** namespace, and new **adjustment** property have been added to the **Shape** class.

This use case explains how to work with adjustment raw values:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document(file_name=MY_DIR + 'Rounded rectangle shape.docx')
shape = doc.get_child(aw.NodeType.SHAPE, 0, True).as_shape()
adjustments = shape.adjustments
self.assertEqual(1, adjustments.count)
adjustment = adjustments[0]
self.assertEqual('adj', adjustment.name)
self.assertEqual(16667, adjustment.value)
adjustment.value = 30000
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Shape.Adjustments.docx')
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added FileFormatInfo.HasMacros property

Provided capability to check for the presence of VBA macros without loading the document.

A new public property **has_macros** has been added to class **FileFormatInfo**:

This use case explains how to check for the presence of VBA macros without loading the document:

{{< highlight python >}}
file_format_info = aw.FileFormatUtil.detect_file_format(file_name=MY_DIR + 'Macro.docm')
self.assertTrue(file_format_info.has_macros)
{{< /highlight >}}

### Implemented a function to eliminate empty pages from the document.

A new public method **remove_blank_pages** has been added to class **Document**:

{{< highlight python >}}
def remove_blank_pages(self) -> None:
    """Removes blank pages from the document.
    
    The resulting document will not contain pages considered to be blank while other content,
    including numbering, headers/footers and overall layout should remain unchanged.
    
    Page is considered to be blank when body of the page have no visible content, for example,
    empty table having no borders will be considered as invisible and therefore page will be detected as blank.
    
    :returns: List of page numbers has been considered as blank and removed."""
    ...
{{< /highlight >}}

### Layout warnings related to tables changed

The logic for two layout warnings related to table layouts has been changed to match the current AW behavior.

- Cell spacing warning "Cell spacing is not supported. The table will be rendered without cell spacing." has been changed to "Cell spacing is not rendered for a table not supported by the new table layout logic.". The warning is only issued when cell spacing is not actually rendered as it is currently rendered for most of the tables, apart from a few cases.

- Autofit table warning "Table column widths may need to be calculated. Rendered column widths could differ." has been changed to "A table not supported by the new table layout logic is encountered. Older logic that has known issues is applied." as table column widths are now always re-calculated for tables supported by the new table layout logic. The warning is only issued for top-level tables not supported by the new logic which is a relatively minor proportion. The logic is not issued for tables nested in other tables, as there can be many nested tables and the whole set is either handled by the new logic or not, so a single warning for the top-level table should be sufficient.
