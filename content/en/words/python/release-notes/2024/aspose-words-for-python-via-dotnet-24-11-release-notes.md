## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words for Python via .NET 24.11. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words for Python via .NET which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added ability to get/set format code of chart data

The [FormatCode](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.drawing.charts/bubblesizecollection/formatcode/) public property has been added to the [ChartXValueCollection](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.drawing.charts/chartxvaluecollection/), [ChartYValueCollection](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.drawing.charts/chartyvaluecollection/) and [BubbleSizeCollection](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.drawing.charts/bubblesizecollection/) classes.

This use case explains how to set format code to chart data collections:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc=doc)
# Insert a Bubble chart.
shape = builder.insert_chart(chart_type=aw.drawing.charts.ChartType.BUBBLE, width=432, height=252)
chart = shape.chart
# Delete default generated series.
chart.series.clear()
series = chart.series.add(series_name='Series1', x_values=[1, 1.9, 2.45, 3], y_values=[1, -0.9, 1.82, 0], bubble_sizes=[2, 1.1, 2.95, 2])
# Show data labels.
series.has_data_labels = True
series.data_labels.show_category_name = True
series.data_labels.show_value = True
series.data_labels.show_bubble_size = True
# Set data format codes.
series.x_values.format_code = '#,##0.0#'
series.y_values.format_code = '#,##0.0#;[Red]\\-#,##0.0#'
series.bubble_sizes.format_code = '#,##0.0#'
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Charts.FormatCode.docx')
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new public option PdfSaveOptions.RenderChoiceFormFieldBorder

A new public option [RenderChoiceFormFieldBorder](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pdfsaveoptions/renderchoiceformfieldborder/) has been added in [PdfSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pdfsaveoptions/) class.

This use case explains how to pecify whether to render PDF choice form field border:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document(file_name=MY_DIR + 'Legacy drop-down.docx')
save_options = aw.saving.PdfSaveOptions()
save_options.preserve_form_fields = True
save_options.render_choice_form_field_border = True
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'PdfSaveOptions.RenderChoiceFormFieldBorder.pdf', save_options=save_options)
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added possibility to summarize text using OpenAI and Google generative language models

Implemented new public members in [Aspose.Words.AI](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.ai/) namespace.

This use case explains how to generate summary for document using OpenAi generative model:

{{< highlight python >}}
first_doc = aw.Document(MyDir + "Big document.docx")
second_doc = aw.Document(MyDir + "Document.docx")
api_key = os.getenv("API_KEY")
# Use OpenAI or Google generative language models.
model = aw.ai.AiModel.create(aw.ai.AiModelType.GPT_4O_MINI).with_api_key(api_key).as_open_ai_model()
options = aw.ai.SummarizeOptions()
options.summary_length = aw.ai.SummaryLength.SHORT
one_document_summary = model.summarize(first_doc, options)
oneDocumentSummary.save(ArtifactsDir + "AI.AiSummarize.One.docx")
options.summary_length = aw.ai.SummaryLength.LONG
multi_document_summary = model.summarize([first_doc, second_doc], options)
multiDocumentSummary.save(ArtifactsDir + "AI.AiSummarize.Multi.docx")
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added properties to get extended document properties

Following read-only properties has been added to [BuiltInDocumentProperties](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.properties/builtindocumentproperties/) class.

Please note that these properties is only supported for DOC and DOCX document formats and for other document formats false value will always be returned.

This use case explains how to use these new properties:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document(file_name=MY_DIR + 'Extended properties.docx')
self.assertTrue(doc.built_in_document_properties.scale_crop)
self.assertTrue(doc.built_in_document_properties.shared_document)
self.assertTrue(doc.built_in_document_properties.hyperlinks_changed)
{{< /highlight >}}

### Add possibility to set caption of ActiveX control

Added a new public setter to [Forms2OleControl.Caption](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.drawing.ole/forms2olecontrol/caption/) property.

This use case explains explains how to change Caption of ActiveX control:

{{< highlight python >}}
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder()
button1 = aw.drawing.ole.CommandButtonControl()
button1.caption = 'Button caption'
shape = builder.insert_forms_2_ole_control(button1)
self.assertEqual('Button caption', shape.ole_format.ole_control.as_forms2_ole_control().caption)
{{< /highlight >}}

### Modified RevisionOptions and RevisionColor classes

It is now possible to specify color for the insert and delete revisions for table cells.

Properties [InsertCellColor](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.layout/revisionoptions/insertcellcolor/) and [DeleteCellColor](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.layout/revisionoptions/deletecellcolor/) were added.

Also new standard colors were added to the [RevisionColor](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.layout/revisioncolor/) enumeration.

This use case explains explains how to specify color for the insert and delete revisions for table cells:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document(file_name=MY_DIR + 'Cell revisions.docx')
doc.layout_options.revision_options.insert_cell_color = aw.layout.RevisionColor.LIGHT_BLUE
doc.layout_options.revision_options.delete_cell_color = aw.layout.RevisionColor.DARK_RED
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Revision.RevisionCellColor.pdf')
{{< /highlight >}}
