## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words for Python via .NET 24.10. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words for Python via .NET which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added ability to create CommandButton ActiveX control

Added a new **insert_forms_2_ole_control** public method to **Aspose.Words.DocumentBuilder** class.
Also added a new **CommandButtonControl** public class to **Aspose.Words.Drawing.Ole** namespace.

This use case explains how to insert CommandButton ActiveX control:

{{< highlight python >}}
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder()
button1 = aw.drawing.ole.CommandButtonControl()
shape = builder.insert_forms_2_ole_control(button1)
self.assertEqual(aw.drawing.ole.Forms2OleControlType.COMMAND_BUTTON, shape.ole_format.ole_control.as_forms2_ole_control().type)
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new public property Shape.Hidden

A new public property **hidden** has been added to **ShapeBase** class:

This use case explains how to use **hidden** property:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document(file_name=MY_DIR + 'Shadow color.docx')
shape = doc.get_child(aw.NodeType.SHAPE, 0, True).as_shape()
if not shape.hidden:
    shape.hidden = True
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Shape.Hidden.docx')
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added option that allows to export tables as HTML when saving document to Markdown

Added a new **export_as_html** public option to **Aspose.Words.Saving.MarkdownSaveOptions** class.
And also a new **MarkdownExportAsHtml** public enumeration to **Aspose.Words.Saving** namespace.

This use case explains how to export table as raw HTML when saving to Markdown:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc=doc)
builder.writeln('Sample table:')
# Create table.
builder.insert_cell()
builder.paragraph_format.alignment = aw.ParagraphAlignment.RIGHT
builder.write('Cell1')
builder.insert_cell()
builder.paragraph_format.alignment = aw.ParagraphAlignment.CENTER
builder.write('Cell2')
save_options = aw.saving.MarkdownSaveOptions()
save_options.export_as_html = aw.saving.MarkdownExportAsHtml.TABLES
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'MarkdownSaveOptions.ExportTableAsHtml.md', save_options=save_options)
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added public properties to format Pie and Doughnut charts

The following public properties have been added to the **ChartSeriesGroup** class for formatting **Pie** and **Doughnut** charts:
1. **first_slice_angle**
2. **doughnut_hole_size**
3. **second_section_size**

This use case explains how to create and format **Doughnut** chart:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc=doc)
shape = builder.insert_chart(chart_type=aw.drawing.charts.ChartType.DOUGHNUT, width=400, height=400)
chart = shape.chart
# Delete the default generated series.
chart.series.clear()
categories = ['Category 1', 'Category 2', 'Category 3']
chart.series.add(series_name='Series 1', categories=categories, values=[4, 2, 5])
# Format the Doughnut chart.
series_group = chart.series_groups[0]
series_group.doughnut_hole_size = 10
series_group.first_slice_angle = 270
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Charts.DoughnutChart.docx')
{{< /highlight >}}

This use case explains how to create and format **Pie of Pie** chart:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc=doc)
shape = builder.insert_chart(chart_type=aw.drawing.charts.ChartType.PIE_OF_PIE, width=440, height=300)
chart = shape.chart
# Delete the default generated series.
chart.series.clear()
categories = ['Category 1', 'Category 2', 'Category 3', 'Category 4']
chart.series.add(series_name='Series 1', categories=categories, values=[11, 8, 4, 3])
# Format the Pie of Pie chart.
series_group = chart.series_groups[0]
series_group.gap_width = 10
series_group.second_section_size = 77
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Charts.PieOfPieChart.docx')
{{< /highlight >}}

### New public methods DocumentBuilder.InsertGroupShape has been introduced

A new **insert_group_shape** public methods in **DocumentBuilder** class has been implemented.
It is now possible to group individual shapes, group shapes together, and directly group both shapes and group shapes.

This use case explains how to work with **insert_group_shape** methods:

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc=doc)
shape1 = builder.insert_shape(shape_type=aw.drawing.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, width=200, height=250)
shape1.left = 20
shape1.top = 20
shape1.stroke.color = aspose.pydrawing.Color.red
shape2 = builder.insert_shape(shape_type=aw.drawing.ShapeType.ELLIPSE, width=150, height=200)
shape2.left = 40
shape2.top = 50
shape2.stroke.color = aspose.pydrawing.Color.green
# Combine shapes into a GroupShape node which is inserted into the specified position.
group_shape1 = builder.insert_group_shape(shapes=[shape1, shape2])
# Combine Shape and GroupShape nodes.
shape3 = shape1.clone(True).as_shape()
group_shape2 = builder.insert_group_shape(shapes=[group_shape1, shape3])
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Shape.CombineGroupShape.docx')
{{< /highlight >}}
