## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 23.12. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added a public property and enumeration to set the initial view page layout that will be used when opening a document in a PDF reader

New public **PageLayout** property has been added to the **PdfSaveOptions** class:
{{< highlight cpp >}}

    class ASPOSE_WORDS_SHARED_CLASS PdfSaveOptions : public Aspose::Words::Saving::FixedPageSaveOptions
    {
        ...
    
        /// <summary>
        /// Specifies the page layout to be used when the document is opened in a PDF reader.
        /// </summary>
        /// <remarks>
        /// The default value is PdfPageLayout.SinglePage/>.
        /// </remarks>
        ASPOSE_WORDS_SHARED_API Aspose::Words::Saving::PdfPageLayout get_PageLayout() const;
        ASPOSE_WORDS_SHARED_API void set_PageLayout(Aspose::Words::Saving::PdfPageLayout value);
    }

{{< /highlight >}}

New public **PdfPageLayout** enumeration has been introduced:
{{< highlight cpp >}}

    /// <summary>
    /// Specifies the page layout to be used when the document is opened in a PDF reader.
    /// </summary>
    enum class ASPOSE_WORDS_SHARED_CLASS PdfPageLayout
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Display one page at a time.
        /// </summary>
        SinglePage,
    
        /// <summary>
        /// Display the pages in one column.
        /// </summary>
        OneColumn,
    
        /// <summary>
        /// Display the pages in two columns, with odd-numbered pages on the left.
        /// </summary>
        TwoColumnLeft,
    
        /// <summary>
        /// Display the pages in two columns, with odd-numbered pages on the right.
        /// </summary>
        TwoColumnRight,
    
        /// <summary>
        /// Display the pages two at a time, with odd-numbered pages on the left.
        /// </summary>
        TwoPageLeft,
    
        /// <summary>
        /// Display the pages two at a time, with odd-numbered pages on the right.
        /// </summary>
        TwoPageRight
    }

### Added LowCode.Merger.Merge method overload with array of Document objects as an input

A new public method **Merge(Document[], MergeFormatMode)** has been added to class **LowCode.Merger**:
{{< highlight cpp >}}

    /// <summary>
    /// Merges the given input documents into a single document and returns <see cref="Document"/> instance of the final document.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="inputDocuments">The input documents.</param>
    /// <param name="mergeFormatMode">Specifies how to merge formatting that clashes.</param>
    static ASPOSE_WORDS_SHARED_API System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Document> Merge(const System::ArrayPtr<System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Document>>& inputDocuments, Aspose::Words::LowCode::MergeFormatMode mergeFormatMode);

### Added public property OoxmlSaveOptions.Zip64Mode and enum type Zip64Mode

New public **Zip64Mode** property has been added to the **OoxmlSaveOptions** class:
{{< highlight cpp >}}

    class ASPOSE_WORDS_SHARED_CLASS OoxmlSaveOptions : public Aspose::Words::Saving::SaveOptions
    {
        ...
        
        /// <summary>
        /// Specifies whether or not to use ZIP64 format extensions for the output document.
        /// The default value is <see cref="Saving.Zip64Mode.Never"/>.
        /// </summary>
        /// <seealso cref="Zip64Mode"/>
        ASPOSE_WORDS_SHARED_API Aspose::Words::Saving::Zip64Mode get_Zip64Mode() const;
        ASPOSE_WORDS_SHARED_API void set_Zip64Mode(Aspose::Words::Saving::Zip64Mode value);
    }

{{< /highlight >}}

New public Zip64Mode enumeration has been introduced:
{{< highlight cpp >}}

    /// <summary>
    /// Specifies when to use ZIP64 format extensions for OOXML files.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// OOXML file is a ZIP-archive that has a 4 GB (2^32 bytes) limit on uncompressed size of a file,
    /// compressed size of a file, and total size of the archive, as well as a limit of 65,535 (2^16-1) files in archive.
    /// ZIP64 format extensions increase the limits to 2^64.
    /// </remarks>
    /// <seealso cref="OoxmlSaveOptions.Zip64Mode"/>

        /// </summary>
        IfNecessary = 1,
    
        /// <summary>
        /// Always use ZIP64 format extensions.

### Slight changes in IStructuredDocumentTag public interface

The new public methods **RemoveSelfOnly** and **GetChildNodes** have been added to **IStructuredDocumentTag** interface:
{{< highlight cpp >}}

    /// <summary>
    /// Removes just this SDT node itself, but keeps the content of it inside the document tree.
    /// </summary>
    virtual void RemoveSelfOnly() = 0;
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Returns a live collection of child nodes that match the specified types.
    /// </summary>
    virtual System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::NodeCollection> GetChildNodes(Aspose::Words::NodeType nodeType, bool isDeep) = 0;

{{< /highlight >}}
    
IsRanged and StructuredDocumentTagNode methods have been converted to IsMultiSection and Node properties.
{{< highlight cpp >}}

    /// <summary>

## Limitations and API Differences

Aspose.Words for C++ has some differences as compared to its equivalent .NET version of the API. This section contains information about all such functionality that is not available in the current release. The missing features will be added in future releases.

- The current release does not support LINQ and Reporting features.
- The current release does not support OpenGL 3D Shapes rendering.
- The current release does not support loading PDF documents.
- The current release has limited support for database features - C++ doesn't have common API for DB like .NET System.Data.
