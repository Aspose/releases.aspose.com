#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Words for C++ 25.2 delivers cutting-edge document intelligence with Claude AI summarization, advanced font spacing control, and public support for Microsoft Works (WPS) document format. This release also improves PDF tagging, OpenType shaping, and boosts multilingual rendering for Asian and Indic scripts across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

#### New Feature

- **Single-Level List Creation**: Introduced `ListCollection.AddSingleLevelList()` to simplify structured list creation.
- **Font Number Spacing**: Added `Font.NumberSpacing` to fine-tune **OpenType typographic behavior**.
- **Claude AI Summarization**: Enabled AI-powered text summarization using **Anthropicâ€™s Claude model**.
- **Microsoft Works Format Support**: Now supports importing documents in **WPS format (Microsoft Works)**.
- **Enhanced PDF Logical Structure**: Added tagging support for **Table of Authorities (TOA)**, **Bibliography**, and **Index** fields in PDF output.

#### Enhancement

- **OpenType & Asian Typography**: Added support for OpenType shaping and improved spacing for **Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Bengali, Lao, and Nepali** text.
- **Math Rendering & Underlines**: Improved underline rendering for **OfficeMath**, and corrected subscript/superscript placement in equations.
- **LowCode Output Support**: `LowCode` APIs now support saving to **Html, HtmlFixed, Svg, and XamlFixed** formats.
- **Chart Labeling & Data Points**: Introduced `ChartDataLabelLocationMode.Absolute` and fixed label misalignment across rotated axis and bin charts.
- **HTML Comment Preservation**: HTML export now maintains MSO-style comments and picture bullets when converting DOCX to HTML.

#### Cross-Platform Notes (macOS and Linux)

- **macOS Support**: Fully compatible with **macOS Monterey 12.0+ (Intel 64-bit)**, with enhanced font shaping, Asian text layout, and PDF rendering.
- **Linux Support**: Supports **Clang 3.9.1+** on **x86_x64 architectures**, now handles AI summarization, OpenType spacing, and multilingual layout more effectively.
- Limitations remain for **Metered Licensing**, **LINQ Reporting**, and **PDF input**; these will be addressed in future builds.

#### Fix

- Resolved formatting, spacing, and layout issues across PDF, DOCX, RTF, HTML, SVG, and image exports.
- Fixed multiple critical exceptions: `NullReferenceException`, `IndexOutOfRangeException`, `FileCorruptedException`, and `DllNotFoundException` (HarfBuzz.dll).
- Improved bullet rendering, indentation preservation, and list import behaviorâ€”especially when using `ImportFormatMode.KeepSourceFormatting`.
- Corrected image resolution problems in HTML output and ensured stable rendering of compressed and non-standard file formats.
- Fixed symbol loss, character misalignment, and mixed RTL/LTR rendering issues across several language scripts.
