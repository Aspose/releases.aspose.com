### Style Management Improvements

New public properties `Priority`, `UnhideWhenUsed`, and `SemiHidden` are added to the `Style` class in this release.

###  Reference Footnote Accurately

This release brings two new additions: the `Footnote.ActualReferenceMark` public property and the `Document.UpdateActualReferenceMarks` public method.

Retrieve the actual text displayed for footnote and endnote reference marks using these properties and methods, ensuring accurate referencing in your documents.

### Preserve Empty Lines in Markdown

Avoid ignoring empty lines at the start and end and between the block-level elements inside the Markdown files.

This feature helps preserve the empty lines during Markdown file import to keep your document structure intact and consistent.

### Expanded DrawingML Chart API

As part of the DrawingML API expansion, the `AxisTickLabels` class has been made available. Additionally, the `TickLabels` property of `AxisTickLabels` is added to the `ChartAxis` class.

Multiple other changes, including making axis tick mark labels related properties marked as obsolete in the `ChartAxis` class, are added.

Format and manage tick label appearance; control various aspects of chart data tables, including visibility, legend keys, and borders. Utilize the extended API to format chart elements like axes and data tables with greater precision.
