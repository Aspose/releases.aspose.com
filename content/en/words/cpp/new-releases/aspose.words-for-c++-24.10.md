#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Words for C++ 24.10 adds robust enhancements across chart formatting, shape visibility, and markdown export. The release introduces CommandButton ActiveX control creation, nested shape grouping, and HTML-style markdown table export, while continuing to improve performance and platform compatibility for macOS and Linux.

#### New Feature

- **ActiveX Control Support**: You can now create **CommandButton ActiveX controls** in Word documents.
- **Shape Visibility**: The new `Shape.Hidden` property allows developers to control the **visibility of shapes**.
- **Nested Group Shape Insertion**: Enhanced `InsertGroupShape` API allows grouping of both individual and existing group shapes.
- **Markdown Export Upgrade**: Added support for exporting **tables as HTML** when saving to Markdown format.
- **Pie and Doughnut Chart Formatting**: Public properties added for fine-tuning **Pie and Doughnut chart styles**.
- **Big5 and Taiwanese Font Support**: Improved support for **Big5 encoding** and outdated **Taiwanese fonts** during rendering and layout.

#### Enhancement

- **Chart Accuracy**: Fixed rendering issues for logarithmic axes and data labels in various chart types.
- **EPUB, HTML, and PDF Improvements**: Enhanced layout precision and text alignment across formats, including font fallback and hyperlink fixes.
- **RTF and MHTML Export**: Resolved bugs related to missing shapes, image colors, and broken layout when exporting documents.
- **Mail Merge Enhancements**: Improved behavior with number formats, hyperlinks, and data sources containing special characters.
- **Document Comparison and Loading**: Reduced exceptions and improved robustness when comparing or loading large and complex files.

#### Cross-Platform Notes (macOS and Linux)

- **macOS Compatibility**: Fully supports **macOS Monterey (12.0+)** for **64-bit Intel-based Mac systems**, ensuring stable rendering, layout, and export operations.
- **Linux Compatibility**: Compatible with **Clang 3.9.1 or later**, supporting **x86_x64 architectures** for reliable document processing and format conversions.
- Features like **LINQ Reporting**, **PDF document loading**, and **Metered Licensing** remain unsupported on C++ and are scheduled for future consideration.

#### Fix

- Fixed shape visibility errors, incorrect text wrapping, and missing elements in rendered PDF output.
- Addressed `InvalidOperationException`, `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`, and other critical errors during comparison, field updates, and rendering.
- Resolved issues in DOCX to PDF and DOCX to MD conversions, especially involving list layout, TOC, Thai/Chinese character rendering, and SDT formatting.
- Eliminated redundant footers, layout drift, and table overlaps during format transitions (e.g., DOCX to HTML to DOCX).
- Corrected Markdown-to-HTML formatting, font embedding issues, and compatibility warnings in PDF/UA validation.
