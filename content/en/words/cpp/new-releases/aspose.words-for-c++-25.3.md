#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Words for C++ 25.3 boosts document processing intelligence with Anthropic-based AI grammar checking, expanded save options for font resolution, and improved PDF attachment handling. This release enhances multilingual rendering and ensures greater stability across platforms including Windows, Linux, and macOS.

#### New Feature

- **AI Grammar Checker**: Added grammar checking support via **Anthropic generative language models** for smarter document proofreading.
- **SaveOptions.UpdateAmbiguousTextFont**: New setting in `SaveOptions` that **resolves ambiguous font mappings**, improving font consistency across outputs.
- **Enhanced PDF Attachments**: Expanded capabilities in `PdfSaveOptions` to **embed and export attachments** with better logical structure compliance.
- **PDF/A-3 Consideration**: Foundation laid for future **PDF/A-3 compliance support**.

#### Enhancement

- **Improved Text Layouts**: Enhanced behavior for paragraph structure import, variable font spacing, and bidirectional text rendering (including RTL alignment and Hebrew/Arabic support).
- **Document Comparison**: Improved merge logic and numbering retention when comparing or appending documents.
- **Mail Merge & Styles**: Fixed font changes after mail merge and improved style preservation from MSO HTML content.
- **Chart & OfficeMath Fixes**: Addressed visual rendering issues in `OfficeMath`, Treemap charts, and curved connectors during PDF and image output.
- **Structured Document Tags (SDT)**: Enhanced stability when working with SDTs linked to custom XML parts or embedded in table structures.

#### Cross-Platform Notes (macOS and Linux)

- **macOS Support**: Fully compatible with **macOS Monterey 12.0+ (Intel 64-bit)** with improved font fallback logic, AI grammar integration, and rendering accuracy for embedded images and shapes.
- **Linux Support**: Requires **Clang 3.9.1+** on **x86_x64 architectures**; resolves layout inconsistencies and improves resilience with malformed or incomplete files.
- Still pending: Full support for **Metered Licensing**, **LINQ Reporting**, and **PDF file input**, planned for future releases.

#### Fix

- Resolved `NullReferenceException`, `InvalidOperationException`, and `ArgumentException` across rendering, comparison, and save operations.
- Fixed table layout drift, image loss, and page breaks in RTF, DOCX, and PDF conversions.
- Improved behavior with CHM plugin loading, diacritic preservation, redaction overlays, and bookmark integrity.
- Enhanced font consistency in DOCX, RTF, and HTML-to-PDF workflows, including SkiaSharp 3.x.x compatibility fixes.
- Corrected issues where bullet lists, hyperlinks, or metadata were imported incorrectly from MSO-styled HTML content.
