#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Words for C++ 24.12 introduces flexible chart data labeling, AI-powered text translation using Google generative models, and smarter Mail Merge output with table cleanup options. This release also expands the low-code API surface and improves document fidelity across formats and platforms.

#### New Feature

- **Chart Data Label Placement**: Added support for customizing chart **data label position** (Center, Inside End, Inside Base, Outside End).
- **Google-Powered Translation**: Enables document text translation using **Googleâ€™s generative language model**.
- **Mail Merge Table Cleanup**: Introduced `RemoveEmptyTables` option to remove entire tables that receive no data during **Mail Merge**.
- **Low-Code API Expansion**: Added new `LowCode` classes like **Comparer** and **Replacer** for streamlined and readable document workflows.
- **OLE Loading Control**: Provided ability to **skip loading linked OLE objects**, improving performance in complex documents.

#### Enhancement

- **Chart & Axis Improvements**: Resolved rendering issues where chart axis labels were getting cut off.
- **RTF, DOCX, and MHTML Fidelity**: Fixed extra page creation, corrupted content, and table layout issues across format conversions.
- **Field and Header Updates**: Corrected TOC font inheritance, STYLEREF rendering, and field behavior under locale-specific settings (e.g. `ru-RU`).
- **Multithreading Support**: Improved handling of `ExtractPages` and cloned document objects across multiple threads.
- **Shape & Image Rendering**: Addressed image quality issues (e.g., soft edge effects), bounding box overlaps, and border inconsistencies.

#### Cross-Platform Notes (macOS and Linux)

- **macOS Support**: Fully compatible with **macOS Monterey 12.0+** on **64-bit Intel architectures**, supporting low-code workflows, chart processing, and HarfBuzz-based rendering.
- **Linux Support**: Requires **Clang 3.9.1 or higher**, with stable operation across **x86_x64 Linux distributions** for PDF export, multilingual content rendering, and large document handling.
- Current C++ version does not yet support **Metered Licensing**, **LINQ Reporting**, or **PDF input** but these are planned for future releases.

#### Fix

- Resolved critical exceptions including `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`, `NullReferenceException`, and `InvalidCastException` during comparison, rendering, and field updates.
- Corrected misplaced or missing content when converting documents to PDF, HTML, and JPEGâ€”especially for Chinese, Korean, and multilingual documents.
- Eliminated formatting loss in SDTs, soft hyphen handling, missing bookmarks, and TOC errors in culture-specific environments.
- Fixed corrupted file handling when loading damaged DOCX/DOTX files and improved PDF layout with proper table, image, and paragraph spacing.
