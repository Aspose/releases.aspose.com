#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Words for C++ 24.9 enhances document rendering and formatting with support for grouped shapes, advanced digital signatures, improved markdown parsing, and footnote/endnote separator control. This release further strengthens cross-platform support for macOS and Linux developers.

#### New Feature

- **Group Shape Insertion**: Introduced `DocumentBuilder.InsertGroupShape` method for drawing group shapes in Word documents.
- **Structured Document Tag API**: Added support for inserting structured document tags (SDTs) via the `DocumentBuilder` class.
- **Advanced Chart Rendering**: Implemented tick mark graduations for radar charts.
- **XAdES-EPES Digital Signatures**: Added capability to sign documents with XAdES-EPES compliant XML-DSig signatures.
- **Markdown Underline Parsing**: Recognize underline formatting when loading Markdown (.md) files.
- **Footnote/Endnote Separator Access**: New public API for accessing and formatting footnote and endnote separators.

#### Enhancement

- **PDF/HTML Layout Stability**: Improved layout fidelity for footers, headers, tables, and inline shapes in PDF output.
- **Markdown Improvements**: Enhanced code block recognition and HTML interpretation when importing Markdown files.
- **Chart Export Enhancements**: Radar, pie, and bar charts now render more accurately across PDF and image exports.
- **Image Rendering**: Resolved darkened EMF images and added SVG font metric improvements.
- **Multi-Format Conversions**: Enabled direct conversions between PDF and formats like EPS, WEBP, and PCL.

#### Cross-Platform Notes (macOS and Linux)

- **macOS Compatibility**: Fully supports **macOS Monterey 12.0+** on **64-bit Intel Macs**, ensuring high-fidelity document rendering and export.
- **Linux Compatibility**: Requires **Clang 3.9.1 or newer**, and supports **x86_x64 platforms** for reliable cross-format document generation.
- Limitations remain for features such as **PDF loading**, **LINQ Reporting**, and **Metered Licensing**, which are planned for future versions of the C++ API.

#### Fix

- Resolved layout shifts and incorrect text positioning in DOCX to PDF and EPUB outputs.
- Fixed issues with footnote separator rendering and incorrect inheritance of styles in captions and SDTs.
- Addressed `InvalidOperationException`, `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`, and other runtime errors during document splitting, rendering, and field updates.
- Eliminated image overlaps, font metric inaccuracies, and broken hyperlinks in HTML and PDF exports.
- Corrected rendering issues involving Arabic, Chinese, and Norwegian content across various culture settings.
