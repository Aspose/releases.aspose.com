#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Words for C++ 25.4 delivers key improvements to document layout, HTML export, and watermark management. New support for JISB4/B5 paper sizes, JavaScript-stripped HTML output, and stream-based watermarking expands flexibility, while LowCode API usability gets a major uplift. Enhanced support for multilingual rendering and improved platform resilience complete this robust update.

#### New Feature

- **JIS Paper Sizes Added**: New support for `PaperSize.JisB4` and `PaperSize.JisB5` for better localization and print layout options.
- **JavaScript-Free HTML Export**: Added `HtmlSaveOptions.RemoveJavaScriptFromLinks` to control embedded JavaScript in exported HTML.
- **Stream-Based Watermark Insertion**: New overload for `Watermark.SetImage(Stream)` enables **stream input for watermark images**, improving file handling efficiency.
- **LowCode API Enhancements**: Improved structure, usability, and extensibility of **LowCode document operations** for developers.

#### Enhancement

- **HTML Import Accuracy**: Refined behavior when importing MSO HTML including better treatment of pseudo-classes (`:hover`), style selectors, and table structure.
- **Asian & RTL Language Support**: Fixed text wrapping, glyph alignment, and font fallback issues for **Thai, Hebrew, and Arabic**.
- **Comparison & Track Changes**: Improved synchronization, list consistency, and bookmark placement during document comparison and revision tracking.
- **Shape and Chart Rendering**: Corrected issues with SVG output, metafile rendering, curved connectors, and EQ field formatting.
- **Mail Merge & SDTs**: Enhanced mapping stability and improved data integrity when handling structured document tags and tracked changes.

#### Cross-Platform Notes (macOS and Linux)

- **macOS Support**: Fully compatible with **macOS Monterey 12.0+ (64-bit Intel)**. Rendering accuracy, emoji support, and metafile processing have been improved.
- **Linux Support**: Compatible with **Clang 3.9.1+** on **x86_x64 systems**. Enhanced stability when handling image rendering, rotated shapes, and malformed HTML structures.
- Limitations remain for **Metered Licensing**, **LINQ Reporting**, and **PDF input**. These are expected to be addressed in future versions.

#### Fix

- Resolved critical exceptions (`NullReferenceException`, `FileCorruptedException`, `InvalidOperationException`) across rendering and conversion operations.
- Fixed extra blank pages in PDF export and incorrect layout for tables, equations, and multilingual paragraphs.
- Restored shape alignment and emoji rendering issues in ODT and DOCX to image/PDF conversions.
- Corrected bookmark loss, table misalignment, and list number resets during document extraction and merging.
- Improved behavior for `ImportFormatMode.KeepSourceFormatting` in HTML-to-Word workflows and refined watermark image scaling and placement.
