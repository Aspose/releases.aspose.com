#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Words for C++ 24.8 delivers powerful updates for document generation and export, including enhanced chart formatting, simplified multi-format conversion, and refined PDF and HTML compatibility. This version also expands support for macOS and Linux developers using modern toolchains.

- **One-Line Document Conversion**: The new `LowCode.Converter` class simplifies conversions between formats such as DOCX, PDF, and XPS.
- **XPS Digital Signatures**: Support added to sign XPS documents using `XpsSaveOptions`.
- **PDF SDT Field Naming**: Enables use of SDT `Title` or `Tag` as field names when exporting to PDF forms.
- **Watermark Preservation**: `Section.ClearHeadersFooters` method can now retain document watermarks.

#### Enhancement

- **HTML and XAML Export**: Improved handling of special characters like backslashes and the yen (Â¥) symbol.
- **PDF Export Accuracy**: Fixed rendering of section breaks, EQ fields, and footnote formatting.
- **Chart and Equation Display**: Improved chart axis bounds, label positions, and OfficeMath symbol fidelity.
- **Document Structure Improvements**: Enhanced handling of Table of Contents, bookmarks, and list alignment across formats.

#### Cross-Platform Notes (macOS and Linux)

- **macOS Support**: This version officially supports **macOS Monterey (12.0+)** for **64-bit Intel-based Macs**.
- **Linux Support**: Compatible with **Clang 3.9.1 or higher**, targeting **x86_x64 architecture**.

#### Fix
