#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Words for C++ 25.1 introduces OpenAI-powered grammar checking, customizable HTML/SVG export settings, and Markdown enhancements for image resolution and OfficeMath output. The release also delivers major fixes for table rendering, layout precision, and improved platform stability across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

#### New Feature

- **AI Grammar Checking**: Integrated **grammar validation powered by OpenAI** to enhance proofreading and linguistic review.
- **HTML & SVG Export Options**: Added `IdPrefix` and `RemoveJavaScriptFromLinks` properties to `HtmlFixedSaveOptions` and `SvgSaveOptions`.
- **Markdown Export Control**: New properties in `MarkdownSaveOptions` allow specifying **image resolution** and controlling **OfficeMath output**.
- **Histogram Bin Configuration**: Enhanced histogram chart rendering with **custom bin size support**.
- **Fixed-HTML Text Shaping**: Added text shaping support to `HtmlFixed` output for more accurate visual representation.

#### Enhancement

- **Table Rendering Accuracy**: Fixed table width, layout flow, and column alignment in PDF, HTML, and XLSX outputs.
- **Image & Chart Improvements**: Resolved issues with rotated axis values, label overlap, soft edges, and chart gridline loss.
- **Document Comparison & Merge**: Improved behavior for tracking revisions, merging content, and hyperlink de-duplication.
- **Markdown & HTML Precision**: Addressed list style issues, formatting loss, and erroneous field exports in DOCX to MD/HTML conversions.
- **Error Handling & Stability**: Reduced critical exceptions (`OutOfMemoryException`, `NullReferenceException`, `FileCorruptedException`) during multi-threaded operations and format conversions.

#### Cross-Platform Notes (macOS and Linux)

- **macOS Support**: Full compatibility with **macOS Monterey (12.0+)** on **64-bit Intel Macs**, now supports text shaping and refined export behavior for fixed-layout formats.
- **Linux Support**: Supports **Clang 3.9.1+** on **x86_x64 architectures** with stable performance for AI features, mail merge, and large document rendering.
- As of 25.1, the following features remain unsupported on C++: **Metered Licensing**, **LINQ Reporting**, and **PDF document loading**â€”these are under future roadmap consideration.

#### Fix

- Fixed shifted text, incorrect footnote behavior, and redundant page breaks across RTF, PDF, and DOCX conversions.
- Resolved chart formatting bugs such as wrong rotation of X-Axis labels, missing divider lines, and incorrect number/date formatting.
- Eliminated issues with numbered lists, shape positioning, SDT placement, and TOC inaccuracies.
- Improved content extraction logic (e.g., `ExtractPages`), hyperlink consistency, and handling of corrupted or malformed documents.
- Addressed rendering regressions for vertical Chinese text, OfficeMath elements, and right-to-left/left-to-right mixed content.
