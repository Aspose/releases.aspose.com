### Apple Silicon Platform Support

We are happy to announce Aspose.Words for C++ support for the Apple Silicon platform (macOS) arm64 edition, optimized for Apple Silicon devices to deliver exception efficiency and performance.

The macOS package now includes two libraries: 
- libAspose.Words.Cpp_arm64.dylib (arm64 architecture)
- libAspose.Words.Cpp_x86_64.dylib (x86_64 architecture)

Automatic library selection (based on your system) is ensured by CMake, allowing a smooth user experience.

### Modify Text of TextBox OLE Control

- `MorphDataControl` and `TextBoxControl` are the new public classes added in this release. 
- A new public property named `Text` is added to the `TextBoxControl` class.

With the help of these newly implemented classes and properties, C++ developers can get or set the content of the TextBox OLE control within their Word document processing apps.

### Manage Stroke Colors

- This release introduces new public properties `ForeThemeColor`, `BackThemeColor`, `ForeTintAndShade`, and `BackTintAndShade`, which are added to the `Stroke` class. 

These properties allow the developers to programmatically control the foreground and background colors of strokes.

### Introducing Bibliography Sources Public API

- `Bibliography` is the new public property added to the [`Document`](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words/document/) class.
- Dedicated classes `Bibliography`, `Source`, `ContributorCollection`, `Contributor`, `Corporate`, `PersonCollection`, and `Person`, together with the `SourceType` enumeration, are also added.

This exciting new addition empowers you to effortlessly manage and manipulate bibliography sources within your C++ Word documents. You have comprehensive control over individual source details, including source metadata and contributor information.
