Usage examples:

IMAGING-34862 Add support of basic 3D entities for dxf->pdf export

{{< highlight java >}}

 private static string\[\] files34862 = new string\[\]

{

"water_mesh.dxf",

"arrow_solids2.dxf",

"conic_pyramid.dxf",

"diamond_solids_cylinder_sphere.dxf",

"surfaces.dxf",

"toruses.dxf",

"meshes.dxf",

"boxes_solids.dxf",

"3dentities.dxf",

"Laurana50k.dxf",

};

foreach (string fileName in files34862)

{

using (CadImage cadImage = (CadImage)Image.Load(InputOutputManager.GetFileInBaseFolder(fileName)))

{

CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();

rasterizationOptions.PageWidth = 1600;

rasterizationOptions.PageHeight = 1600;

rasterizationOptions.TypeOfEntities = TypeOfEntities.Entities3D;

if (string.Equals(fileName, "3dentities.dxf") \|\| string.Equals(fileName, "water_mesh.dxf"))

{

rasterizationOptions.ScaleMethod = ScaleType.GrowToFit;

}

rasterizationOptions.Layouts = new string\[\] { "Model" };

PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();

pdfOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;

string outPath = fileName + ".pdf";

cadImage.Save(outPath, pdfOptions);



}

}

IMAGING-34897 Support PSD layers loading

{{< highlight java >}}

 using (Aspose.Imaging.Image image = Aspose.Imaging.Image.Load(sourceFileName))

{

var psdImage = (Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Psd.PsdImage)image;

var pngOptions = new PngOptions();

pngOptions.ColorType = Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Png.PngColorType.TruecolorWithAlpha;

for (int i = 0; i < psdImage.Layers.Length; i++)

{

psdImage.Layers[i].Save(this.GetFileInOutputFolder(string.Format("layer{0}.png", i + 1)), pngOptions);

}

}

{{< /highlight >}}

IMAGING-34728 PsdImage saved with blank PsdOptions and without PsdOptions are different in channels count

{{< highlight java >}}

 using (Image image = Image.Load(filePath))

{

var psdImage = (PsdImage)image;

var options = new PsdOptions(psdImage);

psdImage.Save(outputPath, options);

psdImage.Save(outputPath2, new PsdOptions(options));

}

Public API and backwards incompatible changes:

{{< /highlight >}}

IMAGING-34645 Remove obsolete TiffOptions constructors

{{< highlight java >}}

 The TiffOptions() empty constructor was removed. Instead use one of the TiffExpectedFormat enumeration values to initialize the newly created options. For example:

TiffOptions options = new TiffOptions(TiffExpectedFormat.TiffCcitRle);

The new constructor gives more understanding and exact conversion is expected to the desired file format.

IMAGING-34633 Remove old dithering properties

The dithering process is now more optimized and predictable. All you need to do is use a new Dither() method instead the old DitheringSettings and RawDitheringMethod properties. The dithering then performed right in-place and you can then review the dithering results by loading pixels or raw data. Additionally the DitheringMethod enum is moved to Aspose.Imaging namespace. The following is an example of the new API usage:

RasterImage img = (RasterImage)Image.Load(path);

img.Dither(DitheringMethod.FloydSteinbergDithering, 4);
