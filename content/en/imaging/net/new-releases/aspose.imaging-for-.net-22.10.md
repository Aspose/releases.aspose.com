# 16 bit/Channel 64-bit PNG Support

Added the support for 16-bit/Channel 64 bit PNG images.

```csharp
using (RasterImage image = (RasterImage)Image.Load("image0.png"))
{
    ImageOptionsBase options = image.GetOriginalOptions();
    image.Save("result.png", options);
}
```

# Improved Handling of CMYK Colors on PSD Export

Previously the imaging API's PSD exporter was saving the `CMYK` colors as `RGB`. This issue has now been resolved.

```csharp
using (JpegImage image = (JpegImage)Image.Load("cat.jpg"))
{
    image.Save(
        "output_CMYK_8.psd",
        new PsdOptions()
        {
            ColorMode = ColorModes.Cmyk
        });
}
```

# Support of Alternative Graphics Engine

Added the support of alternative graphics engine, Aspose.Drawing instead of `System.Drawng.Common/GDI+` for .NET Standard 2.0 and higher configurations.

# Improved DNG to JPG Conversion

`DNG` to `JPG` changes image color.

```csharp
using (Image image = Image.Load("input.dng", new DngLoadOptions() { AdjustWhiteBalance = true }))
{
    image.Save("input.dng.jpg", new JpegOptions());
}
```
