#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Imaging for .NET 25.4 introduces automatic brightness enhancement via histogram normalization, improves CMX to JPG and DICOM image handling, and brings structural refinements to the vector rasterization API.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Histogram Normalization**: Auto-adjust brightness with `NormalizeHistogram()` to maximize visual clarity by stretching the image‚Äôs dynamic range.

### üîß Enhancement

- **CMX to JPG Conversion**: Fixed compatibility issues when converting Corel CMX files to JPG.
- **DICOM Image Support**: Enhanced loading reliability for DCM files.

### üõ† Fix

- Addressed failure in opening specific DICOM images.
- Corrected issues in CMX export when rendering text or applying vector transformations.

### üîç Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New APIs**:
  - `RasterImage.NormalizeHistogram()` ‚Äì Adjusts brightness dynamically using histogram analysis.
  - `RasterImage.AdjustContrast(float contrast)` ‚Äì Applies contrast tuning between -100 and 100.
  - `Image.ImageOperation.HistogramNormalization` ‚Äì Enum for image enhancement operations.

- **Breaking Change**:
  - `VectorRasterizationOptions` no longer inherits from `ImageOptionsBase` (effective from 25.5+). This simplifies its structure and improves clarity.
