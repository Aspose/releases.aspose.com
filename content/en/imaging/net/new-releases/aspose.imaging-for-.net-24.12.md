#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Imaging for .NET 24.12 unifies key image manipulation APIs‚Äîcrop, rotate, resize‚Äîacross all vector and raster formats. This release also optimizes AVIF decoding and enhances file format detection, plus expands batch export options.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Unified Image Manipulation**: Crop, rotate, and resize images uniformly across CDR, SVG, EMF, WMF, EPS, and more.
- **Batch Export Mode**: Enhanced `PageExportingAction` for consistent rendering control across all multipage exportable formats.

### üîß Enhancement

- **AVIF Performance Boost**: Up to 4√ó faster AVIF decoding.
- **TIFF and CDR Improvements**: Resolved hang-ups during frame loading and improved stability for CDR processing.
- **File Format Detection**: Correct format detection for SVGZ, WMZ, EMZ, and MP3 inputs.
- **Vector Rasterization**: Added support for relative page sizing in `VectorRasterizationOptions`.

### üõ† Fix

- Addressed incorrect file format detection for compressed and non-image files.
- Fixed unstable rendering and load errors in TIFF and DICOM formats.
- Improved path handling in vector graphics and corrected export bugs for SmartArt and layered content.

### üîç Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Methods**:
  - Standardized vector/raster crop/rotate/resize APIs.
  - TIFF vector path management and transfer to PSD with `PathResource`/`BezierKnotRecord`.
  - Expanded DICOM metadata manipulation via new tag methods.
- **Multipage Support**:
  - Introduced `MultipageCreateOptions`, `PageExportingAction`, and batch rendering patterns across formats like PDF, TIFF, GIF, etc.
