- Refined resize and export behavior for GIFs.
- Corrected render issues in specific CDR to PNG conversions.
- Enhanced SVG rasterization and fixed path misalignment.
- Improved accuracy for CDR to PDF and GIF frame alignment.

### üõ† Fix

- Fixed path rendering anomalies in SVGs and color mismatches during rasterization.
- Enhanced EMF, CDR, and DICOM rendering fidelity in exported results.

### üîç Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes
