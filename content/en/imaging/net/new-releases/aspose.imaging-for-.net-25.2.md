#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Imaging for .NET 25.2 delivers robust improvements in image format support, memory performance, and metadata handling. This release improves AVIF decoding, expands EXIF retention across formats, and adds XMP data support in SVG files.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **XMP Metadata in SVG**: Full support for reading and preserving XMP metadata when loading or saving SVG images.

### üîß Enhancement

- **AVIF Performance**: Reduced memory footprint and 12x faster processing on AVIF image loads.
- **TIFF Improvements**: Fixed blank image issues and improved EXIF metadata consistency during JPEG to TIFF conversion.
- **PNG 16-Bit Support**: Evaluation mode now gracefully handles PNG BitDepth=16 without throwing errors.
- **CDR Accuracy**: Resolved rendering issues with special characters in CorelDRAW files.
- **EMF to PDF Fix**: Corrected blank output problem for vector-to-PDF conversions.

### üõ† Fix

- Addressed exception issues in PNG conversion scenarios without license keys.
- Corrected output inconsistencies during TIFF export and EMF rendering.
- Fixed orientation mismatches in EXIF data after format conversions.
- Enhanced evaluation-mode handling for PNG and AVIF workflows.

### üîç Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Enhanced APIs for DICOM Tagging**:
  - Add, update, and remove metadata tags dynamically in DICOM images.
- **Extended Metadata Stream APIs**:
  - Get serialized streams and update containers for raster and vector multipage formats.
