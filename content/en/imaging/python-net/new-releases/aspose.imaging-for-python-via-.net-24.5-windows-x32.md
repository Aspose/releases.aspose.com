### Enhanced EPS Rendering

Developers working on 32-bit Windows machines will experience better EPS rendering quality with Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET 24.5. Please check out the following code example, which showcases the EPS loading and rendering functionality, and then save the loaded EPS to PNG format.

```python
from aspose.imaging import Image, LoadOptions, DataRecoveryMode

load_options = LoadOptions()
load_options.data_recovery_mode = DataRecoveryMode.CONSISTENT_RECOVER

with Image.load("input.eps", load_options) as image:
image.save("output.png")
```

### File Processing Improvements

Together with addressing the issues with EPS to PNG export, this release of the Python imaging API delivers enhanced capability to save GIF files without any distortions, and EPS to SVG conversion.

This sample code highlights loading and saving GIF files:

```python
from aspose.imaging import Image

with Image.load("Input.gif") as image:
image.save("Output.gif")

```
*[Source\*](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/python-net/release-notes/2024/aspose-imaging-for-python-net-24-5-release-notes/)*

The following coding snippet shows how to save an EPS file to an SVG vector:

```python

from aspose.imaging import Image

with Image.load("image.eps") as image:
image.save("output.svg")

```

### Better `EmfPlus` Rendering

This release of the imaging API includes an optimized `EmfPlus` rendering capability and now offers improved performance. You can easily render and save `EmfPlus` files to PNG images on your Windows x32 machines as shown in the following example:

```python
from aspose.imaging import Image

with Image.load("test.emf") as image:
image.save("test.png")

```

### Public API Additions

A new property `aspose.imaging.LoadOptions.concurrent_image_processing` has been added to the imaging API in this version.

Download Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET 24.5 today to enhance your image processing workflows in Python applications running on Windows 32-bit machines.
