### Render EPS in High Quality

Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET 24.5 supports building image manipulation solutions on macOS x64 offering better EPS rendering quality. Please check out the following code example, which showcases the EPS loading and rendering functionality, and then save the loaded EPS to PNG format.

```python
from aspose.imaging import Image, LoadOptions, DataRecoveryMode

load_options = LoadOptions()
load_options.data_recovery_mode = DataRecoveryMode.CONSISTENT_RECOVER

with Image.load("input.eps", load_options) as image:
image.save("output.png")
```

### File Processing Enhancements on macOS

The current release of the Python imaging API not only addresses the problems with EPS to PNG export but also delivers an enhanced ability to save GIF files without any distortions, and EPS to SVG conversion.

This sample code highlights loading and saving GIF files:

```python
from aspose.imaging import Image

with Image.load("Input.gif") as image:
image.save("Output.gif")

```
*[Source\*](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/python-net/release-notes/2024/aspose-imaging-for-python-net-24-5-release-notes/)*

The following coding snippet shows how to save an EPS file to an SVG vector:

```python

from aspose.imaging import Image

with Image.load("image.eps") as image:
image.save("output.svg")

```

### Render `EmfPlus` Files

We have included an optimized `EmfPlus` rendering capability in this imaging API version which offers improved performance. You can now render and save `EmfPlus` files to PNG images on your macOS x64 machines as shown in the following example:

```python
from aspose.imaging import Image

with Image.load("test.emf") as image:
image.save("test.png")

```

### Additions to The Public API

This release includes a new property `aspose.imaging.LoadOptions.concurrent_image_processing` to the public API.

Upgrade your Python applications on macOS x64 systems by downloading Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET 24.5 and enhance your image processing projects.
