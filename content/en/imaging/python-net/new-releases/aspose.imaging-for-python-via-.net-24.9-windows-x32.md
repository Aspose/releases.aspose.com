Experience improved memory management, along with precise SVG rendering and better support for EMF to SVG conversions in Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET 24.9 (Win x32) release. Developers can focus on delivering performance optimizations and enhanced image processing using this release.

### Improved TIFF Handling

With the latest Python imaging API version, we have empowered TIFF file-saving capabilities by fixing `ObjectDisposedException` to ensure seamless file-saving processes.

Code sample: 

```python

from aspose.imaging import Image
from aspose.imaging.imageoptions import TiffOptions
from aspose.imaging.sources import StreamSource
from aspose.imaging.extensions import StreamExtensions as streams
from aspose.imaging.fileformats.tiff.enums import TiffExpectedFormat


def save_tiff(stream):
    tiffOptions = TiffOptions(TiffExpectedFormat.TIFF_LZW_RGBA)
	tiffOptions.source = StreamSource(stream)
	with Image.create(tiffOptions, 1000, 1000) as image:
        image.save()

    # does not throw exception
    print(stream.tell())

def tiff_test():
    with streams.create_memory_stream() as ms:
		save_tiff(ms)
		gc.collect(0)
		# does not throw exception
		print(ms.tell())

tiff_test()

```

### SVG Rendering Optimizations

The path closure functionality during SVG rendering has been optimized in the latest Python library release to guarantee accurate output on Windows x32.

Code sample: 

```python

### Example
The sample SVG is exported as an image with an open arc without crossed lines.

from aspose.imaging import Image
from aspose.imaging.imageoptions import SvgRasterizationOptions, PngOptions

inputFilePath = "svgHalfNotch2.svg"
outputFilePath = "svgHalfNotch2.svg.png"
with Image.load(inputFilePath) as image:
	rasterizationOptions = SvgRasterizationOptions()
	rasterizationOptions.page_width = image.width
	rasterizationOptions.page_height = image.height
	pngOptions = PngOptions()
	pngOptions.vector_rasterization_options = rasterizationOptions

	image.save(outputFilePath, pngOptions)

```

### Memory Usage Reduction

Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET 24.9 brings reduced memory footprint for drawing operations by 30% to increase process efficiency significantly. 

Code sample: 

```python

from aspose.imaging import Image, LoadOptions
from aspose.imaging.imageoptions import PngOptions, JpegOptions, BmpOptions

load_options = LoadOptions()
load_options.buffer_size_hint = 200
with Image.load("1.emf", load_options) as image:
    image.save("output.png", PngOptions())

with Image.load("1.emf", load_options) as image:
    image.save("output.jpg", JpegOptions())

with Image.load("1.emf", load_options) as image:
    image.save("output.bmp", BmpOptions())

```

### EMF to SVG Gradient Support

The gradient rendering capabilities of the Python library have now been enriched for you to work with improved gradient handling in EMF to SVG conversions within your Windows x32-powered Python applications.

Code sample: 

```python

from aspose.imaging import Image
input_file = "input.emf";
with Image.load(input_file) as image:
	image.save(input_file + ".svg")

```
