### EPS Rendering Improvements

Python developers working on 64-bit Windows systems can experience better EPS rendering quality with Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET 24.5 release. Please check out the following code example, which showcases the EPS loading and rendering functionality, and then save the loaded EPS to PNG format.

```python
from aspose.imaging import Image, LoadOptions, DataRecoveryMode

load_options = LoadOptions()
load_options.data_recovery_mode = DataRecoveryMode.CONSISTENT_RECOVER

with Image.load("input.eps", load_options) as image:
image.save("output.png")
```

### Improved File Processing

In addition to addressing the EPS to PNG export issues, this version of the Python imaging API delivers enhanced capability to save GIF files without any distortions, and EPS to SVG conversion.

This sample code highlights loading and saving GIF files:

```python
from aspose.imaging import Image

with Image.load("Input.gif") as image:
image.save("Output.gif")

```
*[Source\*](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/python-net/release-notes/2024/aspose-imaging-for-python-net-24-5-release-notes/)*

The following coding snippet shows how to save an EPS file to an SVG vector:

```python

from aspose.imaging import Image

with Image.load("image.eps") as image:
image.save("output.svg")

```

### Optimized `EmfPlus` Rendering

The latest release of the Python API includes an optimized `EmfPlus` rendering functionality and now offers improved performance. You can easily render and save `EmfPlus` files to PNG images on your Windows x64 machines as shown in the following example:

```python
from aspose.imaging import Image

with Image.load("test.emf") as image:
image.save("test.png")

```
*[Source\*](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/python-net/release-notes/2024/aspose-imaging-for-python-net-24-5-release-notes/)*

### Public API Additions

We have added the `aspose.imaging.LoadOptions.concurrent_image_processing` property to the imaging API in this version.

Please download Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET 24.5 to significantly enhance your image processing workflows in Python applications running on Windows 64-bit systems.
