IMAGING-34645 Remove obsolete TiffOptions constructors

{{< highlight java >}}

 The TiffOptions() empty constructor was removed. Instead use one of the TiffExpectedFormat enumeration values to initialize the newly created options. For example:


The TiffOptions() empty constructor was removed. Instead use one of the TiffExpectedFormat enumeration values to initialize the newly created options. For example:


TiffOptions options = new TiffOptions(TiffExpectedFormat.TiffCcitRle);


TiffOptions options = new TiffOptions(TiffExpectedFormat.TiffCcitRle);





The new constructor gives more understanding and exact conversion is expected to the desired file format.

IMAGING-34633 Remove old dithering properties

{{< highlight java >}}

 The dithering process is now more optimized and predictable. All you need to do is use a new dither() method instead the old DitheringSettings and RawDitheringMethod properties. The dithering then performed right in-place and you can then review the dithering results by loading pixels or raw data. Additionally the DitheringMethod enum is moved to com.aspose.imaging package. The following is an example of the new API usage:



RasterImage img = (RasterImage)Image.load(path);



img.dither(DitheringMethod.FloydSteinbergDithering, 4);
