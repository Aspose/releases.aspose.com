# What's new in the Aspose.Imaging for Java 24.3

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Imaging for Java 24.3 introduces key stability and platform compatibility improvements. This update resolves issues with TIFF to PDF conversion, enhances SVG export functionality for Linux environments, and ensures secure handling of read-only image files without triggering unauthorized access exceptions. Additionally, descriptions of base classes and options have been made more user-friendly for developers.

## Enhancements

  When converting TIFF images that have differing horizontal and vertical resolutions, the output PDF now maintains proper aspect ratio, ensuring accurate rendering.

- **Improved File Access on Read-Only Images:**
  Unauthorized access exceptions are no longer triggered when loading images marked as read-only, improving application reliability in restricted environments.

- **SVG Export Fix on Linux:**
  An issue causing failure when saving SVG images from EMF files on Linux has been resolved, allowing consistent cross-platform behavior.
