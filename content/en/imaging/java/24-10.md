# What's new in the Aspose.Imaging for Java 24.10

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Imaging for Java 24.10 delivers significant new capabilities including AVIF image format support and accurate SVG vector effect rendering for non-scaling strokes. The update also enhances image conversion workflows by fixing issues in EPS, DNG, CDR, and DICOM processing and improves precision in region-specific filtering using Gaussian blur.

## New Features

- **AVIF File Format Support:**
  AVIF image format is now fully supported for loading and saving, enabling developers to work with modern, efficient image compression.

- **SVG “non-scaling-stroke” Vector Effect Support:**
  Correctly renders SVG elements using the `non-scaling-stroke` effect, ensuring visual consistency in scaled graphics.

## Enhancements

- **Improved EPS to PNG Export:**
  Resolved an issue that previously blocked EPS-to-PNG conversion with enhanced vector rasterization support.

- **DICOM to PDF Conversion in Evaluation Mode:**
  Fixed export errors when converting DICOM files to PDF while running under evaluation conditions.

- **DNG MemoryStream Detection Fix:**
  Correctly identifies DNG format even when loaded from memory streams, avoiding incorrect TIFF recognition.

- **CDR Color Rendering Fix:**
  Exported CDR graphics now preserve correct CMYK color fidelity, especially when saved to TIFF formats.

- **Region-Specific Raster Filtering Fix:**
  Improved filtering for specified regions using `RasterImage.filter`, now handles rectangular input areas accurately.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes
