# What's new in the Aspose.Imaging for Java 24.12

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Imaging for Java 24.12 introduces powerful enhancements for graphic manipulation and export. This release unifies common image operations such as cropping, rotating, and resizing across all supported formats, and introduces robust support for batch mode export using the `PageExportingAction` API.

## New Features

- **Unified Common Operations Support**  
  Common image operations like crop, rotate, rotate-flip, and resize are now supported across all formats including CDR, SVG, EMF, WMF, EPS, ODG, and more. This enhances consistency and usability in image processing workflows.
  
- **Batch Export Mode for Multipage Formats**  
  New batch processing capabilities are added for all exportable multipage formats including APNG, TIFF, WEBP, GIF, DICOM, and PDF. The `PageExportingAction` API allows for page-specific processing during export, increasing flexibility and performance.

## Enhancements

- **Improved AVIF Decoding Performance**  
  The AVIF image decoding performance has been improved by approximately 4x, significantly speeding up image conversions and processing.
  
- **Better TIFF Frame Handling**  
  TIFF frame loading stability issues have been addressed to prevent hanging during multi-frame operations.

- **More Accurate Format Detection**  
  File format detection for MP3, compressed files (SVGZ, WMZ, EMZ), and other unknown formats is improved to avoid misclassification (e.g., identifying MP3 as JPEG).

- **Fixes for EMF to PDF Regression**  
  A blank output bug in EMF to PDF conversion has been fixed, restoring correct rendering output.

- **Enhanced Vector Rendering and Resizing**  
  Rendering issues in EMF, CDR, and GIF formats have been addressed, including improvements in resizing quality and vector path handling.

- **Support for Relative PageSize in Vector Rasterization**  
  Prevents exceptions when setting relative `PageSize` during rendering of vector formats.

## Bug Fixes

- **CDR Export and Rendering Bugs Fixed**  
  Stability and output accuracy for CDR file export and processing are significantly improved.

- **GIF Export Issues Resolved**  
  Problems with distorted output after resizing or saving GIF images are fixed.

- **SVG Rasterization Accuracy Improved**  
  Fixes ensure correct rendering for paths and other SVG components.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Unified Image Manipulation Methods**  
  Core operations such as `crop`, `resize`, `rotate`, and `rotateFlip` have been standardized and extended to all supported image formats.

- **Extended Support for PageExportingAction**  
  The `PageExportingAction` mechanism is now usable for all multipage exportable image formats.
