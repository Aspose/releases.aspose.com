# What's new in the Aspose.Imaging for Java 24.9

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Imaging for Java 24.9 introduces critical enhancements for EMF to SVG conversion and memory-safe TIFF exports. This version fixes rendering issues with SVG gradients and resolves raster export failures when using memory optimization. Additionally, it ensures proper path closure during SVG rendering and eliminates `ObjectDisposedException` when saving TIFF files from memory streams.

## New Features

- **Fix EMF to SVG Error and Extend SVG Gradient Support:**
  Enhanced EMF to SVG rendering by correcting gradient application and improving compatibility with complex EMF elements.

## Enhancements

- **Corrected Raster Export from EMF with Memory Optimization:**
  Resolved errors in converting EMF to raster formats (PNG, JPEG, BMP) under memory buffer constraints using `LoadOptions.setBufferSizeHint`.

- **SVG Arc Rendering Fix:**
  Improved path rendering logic to ensure arcs in SVG images do not close improperly or generate unwanted lines.

- **Resolved TIFF Save Memory Exception:**
  Fixed `ObjectDisposedException` during TIFF export using memory streams, improving stability in memory-constrained environments.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

No public API additions or removals were introduced in this release.

> ### ⚠️ Platform Support Update
>
> Support for **Java 6 and Java 7** will be **removed starting from Aspose.Imaging for Java 24.10**. Upgrade to a later Java version to continue receiving updates.
