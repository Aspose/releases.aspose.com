# What's new in the Aspose.Imaging for Java 24.2

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Imaging for Java 24.2 delivers powerful new image filtering capabilities and significant performance enhancements. This release introduces support for kernel-based image filtering, optimized memory usage for vector formats, and robust EPS format handling. It also improves format recognition to prevent incorrect classification of file types like MSO and VSIX.

## New Features

- **Kernel Filter Support:**
  A comprehensive set of convolution and deconvolution filters have been added, including emboss, sharpen, blur, and custom kernel options. These filters enable advanced image processing directly within your Java applications.

## Enhancements

- **EPS Format Conversion Improvements:**
  Enhanced EPS to PDF, JPEG, and PNG export handling, addressing previously reported rendering and compatibility issues.
- **Optimized Memory Usage for Vector Formats:**
  A step-by-step record rendering approach has been introduced for formats like CDR and CMX, significantly reducing memory consumption during processing.
- **Improved File Format Recognition:**
  MSO and VSIX files are now correctly rejected as unsupported, avoiding false recognition as SVG files.

## Bug Fixes

- **EPS Image Opening Issues:**
  Fixed problems with loading specific EPS images that previously failed.
- **EPS Export Bugs:**
  Addressed visual discrepancies when exporting EPS to raster formats such as JPG and PDF.
- **File Recognition Fixes:**
  Correctly throw exceptions for unsupported formats like MSO and VSIX instead of misidentifying them.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Added APIs:**
  - Support for a wide range of convolution and deconvolution filters via the `FilterOptionsBase` and `ConvolutionFilterOptions` classes.

- **Removed APIs:**
  - Please refer to the corresponding Aspose.Imaging for .NET 24.2 cumulative API changes for more details.
