# What's new in the Aspose.Imaging for Java 25.2

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Imaging for Java 25.2 introduces substantial performance upgrades and stability fixes, notably ending support for Java 1.6 and 1.7. This release focuses on reducing memory usage in AVIF processing, improving metadata consistency, fixing licensing behavior, and addressing output correctness in TIFF, PNG, and EMF formats.

## Enhancements

- **Reduced Memory Usage for AVIF Format**  
  Memory consumption during AVIF image loading has been reduced by up to 20x, with load speeds improved 12x compared to previous versions, greatly enhancing performance for high-resolution content.

- **Improved EXIF Metadata Retention**  
  EXIF metadata such as orientation is now accurately preserved when converting JPEG to TIFF, ensuring consistency in metadata-dependent workflows.

- **More Robust Licensing Fallbacks**  
  Licensing-dependent operations such as 16-bit PNG creation and AVIF/PNG export now handle evaluation mode and missing licenses more gracefully, avoiding crashes or incorrect outputs.

- **EMF to PDF Rendering Regression Fixed**  
  The previously reported blank output issue during EMF to PDF conversion is resolved.

- **Temporary File Cleanup in PNG to PDF Export**  
  Internal cleanup mechanisms are optimized, ensuring temporary files are properly disposed of after converting PNG images to PDF.

- **Improved Character Rendering in CDR Files**  
  Rendering glitches for specific characters in CDR files have been resolved for better text fidelity.

- **Correct Format Detection and Conversion Fixes**  
  Issues related to incorrect file format detection (e.g., MP3, EPS) and blank TIFF conversion have been corrected, improving reliability of automated format handling.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Dropped Support for Java 1.6 and 1.7**  
  Java 8 or higher is now required starting from Aspose.Imaging for Java 25.2. Users are encouraged to migrate accordingly for continued compatibility.
