# What's new in the Aspose.Imaging for Java 24.6

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Imaging for Java 24.6 introduces robust support for transferring Exif metadata between image formats during export, improving image quality and data preservation. This release also includes key fixes for DICOM to JPEG/PDF conversion, transparency handling in TIFF output, and SVG detection accuracy.

## New Features

- **Exif Metadata Preservation on Export:**
  New functionality allows Exif data to be retained or modified when exporting between supported formats. This ensures that important metadata such as camera settings and timestamps are preserved across transformations.

## Enhancements

- **Improved DICOM Format Support:**
  Fixed multiple issues affecting conversion of DICOM images to PDF and JPEG, enhancing compatibility for medical imaging workflows.

- **Corrected Transparency in PNG to TIFF Conversions:**
  Resolved an issue where transparent PNGs exported to TIFF (Deflate RGB) were rendered with black backgrounds instead of white.

- **Enhanced EMF+ Text Alignment:**
  Fixed bugs related to misaligned text rendering in EMF+ images, resulting in better visual fidelity.

- **SVG Format Detection Accuracy:**
  Improved format detection logic to ensure unknown formats are no longer mistakenly identified as SVG after a valid detection.
