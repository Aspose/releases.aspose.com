# What's new in the Aspose.Imaging for Java 24.4

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Imaging for Java 24.4 introduces the ability to modify DICOM tags directly through the public API, alongside significant improvements to vector and raster image conversions. This release enhances format compatibility, especially for DJVU, EMF, EPS, and PNG files, while also addressing stability concerns such as application crashes and wrapping issues in exports.

## New Features

- **Public API Support for DICOM Tag Editing:**
  Developers can now add, update, or remove specific DICOM metadata tags via the public API. This allows for enhanced control over medical image metadata, supporting compliance and workflow customization.

## Enhancements

- **Improved DJVU to PDF Export:**
  Resolved a bug where the first page in the exported PDF appeared blank when converting DJVU files.

- **Fixed EPS and PS Export Issues:**
  Addressed rendering errors and conversion failures when exporting EPS/PS files to other formats like PNG.

- **Enhanced EMF to PDF Wrapping Support:**
  Fixed issues with text not wrapping correctly during EMF to PDF conversions by resizing to standard A4 dimensions.

- **CDR to DXF Conversion Issue Resolved:**
  Fixed an error preventing successful conversion from CDR to DXF. Output accuracy still limited due to partial CDR v12 support.

- **Optimized PNG Loader with EOF Recovery:**
  PNG files with unexpected end-of-file are now handled more robustly, and overall loader performance has been enhanced.

- **Improved Cross-Platform SVG Handling:**
  Improved stability when saving SVG exports, particularly on Linux environments.

- **Crash Fix with TIFF on Java 21:**
  Resolved EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION when accessing multi-page TIFFs under Java 21.

- **Fixed 64bpp PNG Export Issues:**
  Resolved `ArgumentNullException` when converting high bit-depth PNGs to lower bit-depth formats.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Added APIs:**
  - DICOM tag manipulation via `DicomImage.getFileInfo().addTag()`, `updateTagAt()`, and `removeTagAt()`.

- **Removed APIs:**
