## API changes ##
This version is mainly a bug fix version, so no code samples.

### Added Classes ###
  * class Aspose.ThreeD.Shading.PbrSpecularMaterial - This is used to represent the specular pbr material, right now only supported in GLTF 2.0.
  * Added class Aspose.ThreeD.Entities.VertexElementHole - for supporting hole in FBX's mesh
### Added Members ###
  * Added member to enum type Aspose.ThreeD.Entities.VertexElementType
```
public static Aspose.ThreeD.Entities.VertexElementType Hole;
```
  * Added members to class Aspose.ThreeD.FileFormat
```
public static readonly Aspose.ThreeD.FileFormat Zip;
```
With this new file format support, Aspose.3D can import a zip file that contains a 3D file. Usually you don't need to manually use this.
