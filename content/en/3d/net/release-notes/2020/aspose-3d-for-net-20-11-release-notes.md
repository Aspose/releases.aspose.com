## API changes ##


The major change in this version is the exported HTML5 file will no longer use the old renderer.

Instead a WebAssembly-based renderer are used for rendering.

A lots of bug were fixed in this version.

### Added new property to class Aspose.ThreeD.Entities.VertexElementUserData:

{{< highlight java >}}

        Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities.IArrayList<int> Indices{ get;}

{{< /highlight >}}

This property is added so fbx files contains indiced user data can be correctly imported.


### Added new property to class Aspose.ThreeD.Formats.IOConfig:

{{< highlight java >}}

        System.Text.Encoding Encoding{ get;set;}

{{< /highlight >}}

This is used to override the default internal encoding during import/export, so you can manually control the encoding of text-based formats.
