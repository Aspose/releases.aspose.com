## **Improvements and Changes**

|**Key**|**Summary**|**Category**|
| :- | :- | :- |
| THREEDNET-1169 | Add support of .NET 6.0 | New Feature |
| THREEDNET-1166 | Switch to USDZ as HTML5's default internal format | New Feature |

## API changes ##


The old A3DW format was used as HTML5's internal format, now it's obsoleted and replaced by the USDZ, which can provide more features and extensibility.

22.7 now supports .NET 6.0, which can benefit from the performance boost of the .NET 6.0.

This version does not have major API changes.
