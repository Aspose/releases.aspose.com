Added property Target/Direction on Light/Camera

Collada/3ds and some other files uses Target/Direction to set Light/Camera's orientation.

Added more member methods and operator overloads for Vector2/Quaternion.

It's used for internal calculation, and also useful for customers.

Added a new class PolygonModifier.

Some file formats only supports triangle meshes while Aspose.3D support polygon meshes, so we added this class to allow convert a polygon-based meshes into triangle-based meshes.
We'll add more mesh modifications in the future.

Added several IOConfig sub-classes like FBXConfig/OBJConfig/STLConfig/Discreet3DSConfig

Allow user to set options during the importing/exporting like 3ds max/Maya/blender did.
