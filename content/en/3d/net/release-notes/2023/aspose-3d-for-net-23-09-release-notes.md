### API Changes

We'll migrate to System.Numerics in the future, and these changes are the first step to make our product compatible to System.Numerics:

### Added members to class **Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities.BoundingBox**:

        public bool Contains(Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities.Vector3 p)

For FVector2/FVector3/FVector4/Vector2/Vector3/Vector4/Quaternion, these changes are applied:

* Old fields x/y/z/w are replaced by properties wth same name for back compatibility.
* New fields X/Y/Z/W are used.
