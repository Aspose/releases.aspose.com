## API changes ##


This version is mainly a bug-fix version, fixed a lot of bugs, and improved a lot of compatibility for FBX, Collada, DirectX X files.


Only a few minor API changes.

### Added new data type in class Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities.VertexFieldDataType:

{{< highlight java >}}

    /// <summary>
    /// Type of byte[4], can be used to represent color with less memory consumption.
    /// </summary>
    public static Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities.VertexFieldDataType ByteVector4;

{{< /highlight >}}

The VertexElementVertexColor in Aspose.ThreeD.Entities.Geometry will be encoded as a 4 bytes integer with type VertexFieldDataType.ByteVector4.

This can reduce the final generated file largely in glTF/glb that used vertex color, very useful for encoding point clouds.

And from this version, the Aspose.ThreeD.Entities.PointCloud is supported in glTF/glb open and save.



### Added members to class Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities.BoundingBox 


{{< highlight java >}}


    /// <summary>
    /// The size of the bounding box
    /// </summary>
    Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities.Vector3 Size{ get;}

    /// <summary>
    /// The center of the bounding box.
    /// </summary>
    Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities.Vector3 Center{ get;}

{{< /highlight >}}

Now it's easier to get the size and center of the bounding box, these properties only make sense when the BoundingBox is finite.
