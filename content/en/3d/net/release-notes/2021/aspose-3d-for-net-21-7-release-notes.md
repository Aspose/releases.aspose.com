## API changes ##



### Added USDZ as export type ###

From 21.7 you can export scene into USDZ by:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
    Scene scene = new Scene();
    //...prepare your scene
    scene.Save("test.usdz", FileFormat.USDZ);
{{< /highlight >}}


### Added class Aspose.ThreeD.Formats.FileSystemFactory ###


{{< highlight csharp >}}
    /// <summary>
    /// <see cref="SaveOptions"/> and <see cref="LoadOptions"/> will create a <see cref="LocalFileSystem"/> for default.
    /// This can be a security issue in server environment.
    /// Use your own <see cref="FileSystemFactory"/> to <see cref="IOConfig.FileSystemFactory"/> to improve server side security.
    /// </summary>
    /// <returns></returns>
    public delegate FileSystem FileSystemFactory();
{{< /highlight >}}


### Added new property FileSystemFactory to Aspose.ThreeD.Formats.IOConfig:


{{< highlight csharp >}}
        /// <summary>
        /// Gets or sets the factory class for FileSystem.
        /// The default factory will create <see cref="LocalFileSystem"/> which is not suitable for server environment.
        /// </summary>
        public static FileSystemFactory FileSystemFactory { get; set; }
{{< /highlight>}}



It could be dangerous if the user made a malicious 3D file and uploaded the content to your server, the new FileSystemFactory allows you to specify your own implementation of FileSystem to replace the original LocalFileSystem which may read your sensitive data during exporting a 3D file.







### Added new property to Aspose.ThreeD.FileFormat:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
        /// <summary>
        /// Gets whether Aspose.3D supports export scene to current file format.
        /// </summary>
        public bool CanExport { get; set; }
        /// <summary>
        /// Gets whether Aspose.3D supports import scene from current file format.
        /// </summary>
        public bool CanImport { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

You can test if a file format supports import or export through these properties.
