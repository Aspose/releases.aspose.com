## API changes ##


### Added USD as export type ###

From 21.6 you can export scene into a USD file by:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
    Scene scene = new Scene();
    //...prepare your scene
    scene.Save("test.usd", FileFormat.USD);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new class Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities.ZipArchiveFileSystem ###

It's possible for glb/fbx and other file formats that supports texture embedding to access external assets through a zip file by using a ZipArchiveFileSystem to SaveOptions.FileSystem.


### Added new property to class Aspose.ThreeD.Formats.FbxSaveOptions ###

{{< highlight csharp >}}
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets whether to embed the texture to the final output file.
    /// FBX Exporter will try to find the texture's raw data from <see cref="IOConfig.FileSystem"/>, and embed the file to final FBX file.
    /// Default value is false.
    /// </summary>
    public bool EmbedTextures{ get;set;}
{{< /highlight >}}


Sample code:

{{< highlight java >}}
    var scene = new Scene();
    var opt = new FbxSaveOptions(FileFormat.FBX7700ASCII);
    opt.EmbedTextures = true;
    var tex = new Texture();
    tex.FileName = "test.png";
    tex.SetProperty("RelativeFilename", "test.png");
    var mat = new PhongMaterial();
    mat.SetTexture(Material.MapDiffuse, tex);
    var planeNode = scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode(new Plane());
    planeNode.Material = mat;
    scene.Save("plane-with-texture.fbx", opt);
