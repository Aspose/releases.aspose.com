## System Requirements for Aspose.3D for .NET

### Overview

Aspose.3D for .NET allows building and manipulating 3D file formats without the need for external modeling or rendering software. The API also includes a document generation engine.

### Supported Operating Systems

> #### Windows
> Windows 2003 to 2019 Server, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, and Azure
> #### macOS
> Mac OS X (10.12+)
> #### Linux
> Supports various Linux distributions with .NET 4.0 Framework via Mono or .NET Core compatibility.

### Rendering Support

> #### OpenGL: Requires OpenGL 4.3 hardware support, compatible with:
>  - NVIDIA Ge-Force 400 series and newer
>  - AMD Radeon HD 5000 series and newer
>  - Intel HD Graphics (Haswell processors and newer)

> #### Vulkan: Supports x64 platform only, with hardware compatibility for:
>  - AMD Radeon 7700 series and newer
>  - NVIDIA GeForce 600 series and newer
>  - Intel Skylake and newer

### Development Environments

> - Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 - 2019

### Supported .NET Framework Versions

> - .NET Framework 4.0 and later
> - .NET Standard 2.0 (for .NET Core 2.0/2.1)

### Development Environments

> - Microsoft Visual Studio 2010/2011/2012/2013/2015/2017/2019

### Supported .NET Framework Versions

> - .NET Framework 4.0 to 4.7.2
> - .NET Standard 2.0 (including .NET Core 2.0/2.1)

## Get Started

Are you ready to give Aspose.3D for .NET a try? Simply execute `Install-Package Aspose.3D` from the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio to fetch the NuGet package. If you already have Aspose.3D for .NET and want to upgrade the version, please execute `Update-Package Aspose.3D` to get the latest version.

## Build a Scene with Primitive 3D Models using C# Code

You can execute the below code snippet to see how Aspose.3D performs in your environment or check the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aspose-3d/Aspose.3D-for-.NET) for other common usage scenarios.

```csharp
// initialize a Scene object
Scene scene = new Scene();
// create a Box model
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode("box", new Box());
// create a Cylinder model
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode("cylinder", new Cylinder());
// save drawing in FBX format
scene.Save(dir + "output.fbx", FileFormat.FBX7500ASCII);
```

## Export 3D Scene to Compressed AMF via C# Code

Aspose.3D for .NET enables you to save 3D meshes in custom binary format, get all property values of 3D scenes as well as flip their coordinate system. The following example demonstrates the conversion of a 3D scene to AMF format while applying compression to it.

```csharp
// load a scene
Scene scene = new Scene();
var box = new Box();
var tr = scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode(box).Transform;
tr.Scale = new Vector3(12, 12, 12);
tr.Translation = new Vector3(10, 0, 0);
tr = scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode(box).Transform;
// scale transform
tr.Scale = new Vector3(5, 5, 5);
// set Euler angles
tr.EulerAngles = new Vector3(50, 10, 0);
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode();
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode().CreateChildNode(box);
scene.RootNode.CreateChildNode().CreateChildNode(box);
// save compressed AMF file
scene.Save(dir + "output.amf", new AMFSaveOptions() {
  EnableCompression = true
});
```
