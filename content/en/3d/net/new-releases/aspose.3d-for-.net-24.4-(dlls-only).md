The Aspose.3D for .NET 24.4 (DLLs-only package) offers a streamlined solution for developers seeking to integrate Blender imports into their .NET projects. 

### Announcing Blender Support

With Blender support, C# developers can take their 3D file processing apps to the next level and import Blender models directly into their solutions.

### Upgraded DXF to glTF Conversion

This update to the 3D C# API includes improved handling of DXF files, and enhances DXF to glTF conversion.

### Public API Changes

To facilitate seamless Blender integration, we have added the relevant file format, `Blender`, to the existing class `Aspose.ThreeD.FileFormat`.
