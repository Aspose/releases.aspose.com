#### Release Highlights

This DLLs-only release of Aspose.3D for .NET 24.12 refines GLB and FBX workflows with **better morphing mesh support** and a **fix for invalid animation curves**. It also includes a minor but important **class renaming for IO utilities** to ensure future extensibility.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **GLB Morph + Deformer Integration**: Improved data retention and morph animation precision for `.glb` assets.
- **Mesh Splitting with Deformers**: Splitting operations now respect and preserve deformers for animation continuity.

### üîß Enhancement

- **IOUtils Renamed**: `IOUtils` ‚Üí `IOExtension` for semantic clarity in internal file operations.

### üõ† Fix

- **FBX Fix**: Eliminated runtime error from malformed FBX animation curve definitions.

#### üö® API Change Summary

- **Renamed**:  
  `Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities.IOUtils` ‚Üí `Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities.IOExtension`
