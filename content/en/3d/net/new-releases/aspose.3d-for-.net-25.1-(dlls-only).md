#### Release Highlights

The DLLs-only release of Aspose.3D for .NET 25.1 introduces robust **glTF animation and skinning import**, enabling more accurate rendering pipelines. Draco compression has been stabilized across encoding and decoding workflows, while FBX morph animations now export as expected.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **glTF Animation Support**: Load motion and deformation animation from `.gltf` assets.
- **Skinning Import**: Process skeletal data in glTF for realistic mesh deformation.
- **Export Deform Weight Animation to glTF**: Animate morph targets directly in the glTF export pipeline.

### üîß Enhancement

- None added in this release.

### üõ† Fix

- **Draco Fixes**:
  - DRC decoding now functions correctly.
  - glTF meshes using Draco are accurately imported and exported.
- **FBX Animation Fix**: Morph weight animations now export correctly from `MorphTargetChannel`.

#### üö® API Changes

No new or removed public APIs.
