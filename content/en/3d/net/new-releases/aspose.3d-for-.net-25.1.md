#### Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for .NET 25.1 enhances its glTF handling with full **animation import**, **skinning support**, and **deform weight export**. This release also addresses key issues in **Draco compression**, ensuring accurate decoding and export behavior across glTF and FBX formats.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **glTF Animation Import**: Added support for loading animation data directly from `.gltf` files.
- **Skinning Import (glTF)**: Import glTF files with bone-based skin deformation.
- **glTF Export - Deform Weight Animation**: Export animated morph weights to glTF with improved precision.

### üîß Enhancement

- None in this release.

### üõ† Fix

- **Draco Compression Issues**:
  - Fixed decoding failure when loading certain DRC files.
  - Resolved broken Draco mesh loading in glTF importer.
  - Fixed regression causing broken Draco compression during glTF export.
- **FBX Morph Target Bug**: Resolved issue where animations on `MorphTargetChannel.ChannelWeight` could not be exported to FBX.
