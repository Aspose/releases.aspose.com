Upgrade your .NET app development experience with the latest Aspose.3D for .NET 24.1 (MSI installer). This release empowers you with improved 3D animation features and broader file format compatibility.

### Enhanced Animation Handling

Add animations and boost your C# 3D applications by converting Euler angle-based animations to quaternion-based animations for smoother rendering.

### Expanded File Format Support

We have introduced support for FBX, glTF, and USDZ formats in Aspose.3D for .NET 24.1. This allows you to export your animations to a file format of your choice.

### Improved glTF Export

It is now possible to ensure accurate keyframe resampling and handle incomplete keyframe sequences during glTF conversion within the 3D document processing apps.

### 3MF Support with Assembled Structures

.NET developers utilize the features in the latest 3D API release to work with 3D Manufacturing Format (3MF) files containing assembled structures.

### Bug Fixes

This release addresses issues related to JT file loading, NaN rotations, corrupted textures, and USDZ/glTF conversion.
