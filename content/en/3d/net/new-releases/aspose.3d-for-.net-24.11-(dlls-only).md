#### Release Highlights

The DLLs-only package of Aspose.3D for .NET 24.11 brings advanced **morphing support** and **deformer integration** for GLB/FBX workflows. It ensures reliable triangulation of morph targets and maintains deformers when splitting meshes‚Äîessential for high-quality 3D animations and blend shapes.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **GLB Morph Deformers**: Supports deformer retention during import of `.glb` assets.
- **Vertex Morphing Attributes**: Enhanced `TriMesh` to include morph-based vertex transformations.

### üîß Enhancement

- Mesh-splitting operations now retain linked deformers.

### üõ† Fix

- Fixed FBX animation curve loading failure caused by malformed definitions.

---

#### üö® API Additions

**To `Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities.VertexFieldSemantic`**:
- `MorphPosition` ‚Äì Enables morph-based position attributes.
- `MorphNormal` ‚Äì Enables morph-based normal attributes.
