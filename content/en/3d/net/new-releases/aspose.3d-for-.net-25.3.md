#### Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for .NET 25.3 brings powerful enhancements to solid modeling workflows with **Boolean entity support**, **half-space definitions**, and **advanced B-Rep tessellation**. It also resolves multiple critical issues including **GLTF animation validation**, **non-manifold meshes**, and **GLTF-to-OBJ conversion bugs**.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Boolean Operations API**: Introduced `BooleanOperand`, `BooleanOperator`, and `HalfSpace` entities for solid geometry modeling and computational geometry operations.
- **Advanced B-Rep Support**: Robust handling for B-Rep-based modeling with Boolean compatibility.

### üîß Enhancement

- **NURBS Degree Property**: Access or modify the degree of a `NurbsCurve` directly with `Degree` property (instead of `Order`).
- **ArbitraryProfile Holes**: New `Holes` collection allows closed curves to define voids in custom profiles.

### üõ† Fix

- **GLTF to OBJ Conversion**: Resolved geometry mapping issues during format conversion.
- **B-Spline Tessellation**: Fixed failure in curve tessellation under certain conditions.
- **Boolean Operand Compatibility**: Advanced B-Rep meshes now usable in Boolean operations.
- **Mesh Validity**: Improved manifold property of meshes from linear extrusion.
- **GLB Export**: Animation data in exported GLB files now passes glTF validation.
- **SonarQube Issues**: Addressed high-priority code quality warnings.

#### üö® API Changes

- **Added Classes**:
  - `Aspose.ThreeD.Entities.BooleanOperand`
  - `Aspose.ThreeD.Entities.BooleanOperator`
  - `Aspose.ThreeD.Entities.HalfSpace`

- **NurbsCurve**:
  - `int Degree { get; set; }`

- **ArbitraryProfile**:
  - `List<Curve> Holes { get; }`
