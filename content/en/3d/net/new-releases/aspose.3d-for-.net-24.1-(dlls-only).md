Integrate the advanced functionalities of Aspose.3D for .NET 24.1 into your 3D document processing projects with the DLLs-only package. This release offers significant enhancements for 3D animation and file format compatibility.

### Optimized Animation Handling

Boost your C# 3D applications by converting Euler angle-based animations to quaternion-based animations for smoother rendering.

### Broader File Format Support

Support for FBX, glTF, and USDZ formats has been introduced in Aspose.3D for .NET 24.1. This allows you to export your animations to a file format of your choice.

### Enhanced glTF Export

Effectively ensure accurate keyframe resampling and handle incomplete keyframe sequences while converting glTF within the C# 3D file manipulation solutions.

### 3MF Support

Using the latest 3D API release, .NET developers can work with 3D Manufacturing Format (3MF) files containing assembled structures.

### Bug Fixes

This release addresses issues related to JT file loading, NaN rotations, corrupted textures, and USDZ/glTF conversion.
