Aspose.3D for .NET 24.5 (DLLs-only package) release enhances Blender and JT file compatibility and improves watermark security. Additionally, various bugs have been fixed, ensuring smoother processing of 3D models in your cross-platform C# and VB.NET solutions.

### Secure Your Watermarks

The latest .NET 3D API release helps you prevent users from overriding existing password-protected watermarks to ascertain the integrity of your 3D content.

### Refined Blender Import

The functionality of importing Blender files with nested textures, skeletons, and deformed animations has been refined in Aspose.3D for .NET 24.5 release.

### Robust JT Compatibility

We have optimized the compatibility with JT files by resolving the problems affecting the import of compressed vertex color arrays and TopoMesh’s compressed LOD data in JT 9.5 files.

### Addition of Version Information

We have introduced a new field to the `Aspose.ThreeD.Scene` class in this C# 3D library release, which offers access to the current Aspose.3D assembly version.
