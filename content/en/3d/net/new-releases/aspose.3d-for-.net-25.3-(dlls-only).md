#### Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for .NET 25.3 (DLLs-only) expands solid modeling with a new Boolean entity API, introduces **HalfSpace** geometry, and adds **advanced B-Rep** enhancements. Several critical rendering and geometry-related bugs have also been resolved.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Boolean Entities for 3D Geometry**: New support for Boolean operand and operator objects including HalfSpace representation.
- **Hole Definition in Profiles**: `ArbitraryProfile.Holes` allows internal voids within profile definitions.

### üîß Enhancement

- **`NurbsCurve.Degree` Property**: Fine-grained control over NURBS curves independent of order.
- **Improved Code Quality**: Cleaned critical warnings reported by SonarQube analysis tools.

### üõ† Fix

- **GLTF/OBJ Interoperability**: GLTF to OBJ conversion stability restored.
- **GLB Export Validation**: GLB animation exports now conform to glTF schema.
- **Mesh Topology Fixes**: Ensures meshes from B-Rep and extrusion remain manifold.
- **Tessellation Reliability**: Resolved failures in B-spline curve tessellation.

#### üö® API Changes

- **New Classes**:
  - `BooleanOperand`, `BooleanOperator`, `HalfSpace` in `Aspose.ThreeD.Entities`

- **New Properties**:
  - `NurbsCurve.Degree`
  - `ArbitraryProfile.Holes`
