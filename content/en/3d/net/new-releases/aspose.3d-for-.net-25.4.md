#### Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for .NET 25.4 adds robust **glTF metadata support** via the EXT_structural_metadata and EXT_mesh_features extensions. This enables importing and exporting structured metadata in glTF scenes. Also included is a key fix for loading glTF files exported from Ready Player Me.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **EXT_mesh_features Export**: Introduced metadata export support for glTF using the `EXT_mesh_features` extension, enabling semantic annotations of 3D elements.
- **glTF Structural Metadata**: New API allows importing EXT_structural_metadata with class definitions, enum types, and property tables.

### üîß Enhancement

- **glTF Interoperability**: Enhanced compatibility with third-party tools like Ready Player Me. glTF files previously unreadable can now be successfully loaded and processed.

### üõ† Fix

- **GLTF Import**: Fixed a critical bug preventing the import of GLTF files exported by Ready Player Me, ensuring wider interoperability.

#### üö® API Changes

- **New Classes**:
  - `Aspose.ThreeD.Formats.GLTF.StructuralMetadata`
  - `ClassType`, `EnumType`, `EnumValue`, `Property`, `PropertyTable`

These classes allow full read access to metadata embedded in glTF files.
