#### Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for .NET 25.4 (DLLs-only) unlocks metadata capabilities for glTF via support for `EXT_structural_metadata` and `EXT_mesh_features`, improving 3D object context and data semantics. Additionally, this release resolves GLTF import failures caused by metadata content.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Structured Metadata API**: Added new API classes to extract structured metadata (property tables, enums, class definitions) from GLTF scenes.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Metadata Interoperability**: Enhanced parsing of glTF extensions from custom and 3rd-party generators.

### üõ† Fix

- **GLTF Import Handling**: Fixed edge cases causing metadata-related import errors.
