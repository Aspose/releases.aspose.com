Aspose.3D for .NET 24.6 (MSI) offers improved performance for Google Draco encoding and decoding, along with crucial bug fixes related to PBR materials and GLTF output. This release is designed for developers who want seamless 3D object manipulation and conversion in their C# apps.

### Performance Boost in Google Draco Encoding and Decoding
The performance of Google Draco encoding and decoding has been notably optimized in this C# 3D data manipulation API release, allowing for faster and more efficient 3D data compression and decompression.

### Boost PBR Material Preservation
We have resolved the issues that caused distorted or lost appearance of PBR materials from GLB files when converted to FBX, ensuring accurate material handling in conversions.

### GLTF Output Refinement
The problems with GLTF output that generated redundant materials have been fixed, resulting in cleaner and more efficient file exports within your C# 3D apps.
