#### Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for .NET 24.11 enhances support for morphing and deformation workflows by enabling **GLB deformer preservation**, **morph target triangulation**, and mesh-splitting with deformers intact. This release also resolves a critical issue related to malformed FBX animation curve data and expands the vertex semantic capabilities to accommodate morphing attributes such as **MorphPosition** and **MorphNormal**.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **GLB Deformer Support**: Added the ability to load and retain deformers when importing `.glb` files.
- **Morph Target Triangulation**: `TriMesh` now supports morph-based positional and normal triangulation.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Split Meshes with Deformers**: Preserves deformers while performing mesh-splitting operations.

### üõ† Fix

- **FBX Import Fix**: Resolved `System.InvalidOperationException` caused by malformed animation curve definitions in FBX files.

---

#### üö® API Changes

**New Vertex Semantics Added** to `Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities.VertexFieldSemantic`:
- `MorphPosition`: Represents positional offsets used for morphing.
- `MorphNormal`: Represents normal vector offsets used for morphing.
