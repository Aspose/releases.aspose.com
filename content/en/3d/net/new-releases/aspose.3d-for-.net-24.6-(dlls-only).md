Great news for .NET developers! Aspose.3D for .NET 24.6 (DLLs Only) is now available, and it helps developers integrate robust 3D data manipulation and conversion features directly into their C# and VB.NET applications across Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms.

### Optimize Google Draco Encoding & Decoding
This version of the C# 3D apps API brings a major performance boost in Google Draco encoding and decoding. You can now experience faster handling of 3D object compression.

### FBX Conversion Fixes for PBR Materials
The issues causing PBR materials from GLB files to lose appearances during conversion to FBX have been resolved in Aspose.3D for .NET 24.6, ensuring material properties are retained.

### GLTF Material Efficiency
Another important update in this .NET API version is the fix we added for the issues with GLTF output that generated redundant materials, resulting in cleaner and more efficient file exports within your C# 3D apps.
