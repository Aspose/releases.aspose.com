# Improved Loading of 3D Formats

The 3D API was throwing exception while loading `glTF`, `X`, and `VRML` files. These 3D formats are now fully compatible and being loaded without any issues.

# Tangent/Binormal Recognition in GLB

Previously in some instances the Tangent/Binormal defined in `GLB` with Draco enabled was not being recognized. This issue has been resolved within this release of the API.

# Improved Conversion of 3D Formats

Improvements have been made to the following 3D format conversions:

- **ASE to 3DS** Autodesk&reg; ASCII Scene Export (ASE) file format to 3D Studio Format conversion.
- **ASE to OBJ** Autodesk&reg; ASCII Scene Export (ASE) file format to OBJ Format conversion.
- **USD to DRC** Pixar's Universal Scene Description (USD) file format to Google Draco (DRC) format.
