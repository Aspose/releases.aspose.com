Aspose.3D for .NET 24.5 (MSI) release focuses on enhancing compatibility with Blender and JT file formats and improving watermark security. Weâ€™ve addressed several bugs to ensure smoother processing of your 3D models within your C# and VB.NET applications.

### Secure Watermarking 

With the latest .NET 3D API release, you can prevent users from overriding existing watermarks if they are password-protected and ensure the integrity of your 3D content.

### Improved Blender Import

The issues related to importing Blender files with nested textures, skeletons, and deformed animations have been resolved in Aspose.3D for .NET 24.5.

### Enhanced JT Compatibility

We have taken care of the problems affecting the import of compressed vertex color arrays and TopoMesh's compressed LOD data in JT 9.5 files.

### Version Information Added

A new field has been introduced to the `Aspose.ThreeD.Scene` class in this C# 3D library version, providing access to the current Aspose.3D assembly version.

### Bug Fixes

This release primarily addresses bugs related to file import and other API functionalities, along with improvements to the watermarking features.
