#### Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for .NET 24.12 further advances 3D rendering workflows with **enhanced morphing support** in GLB files and **improved TriMesh capabilities**. This version also maintains deformers during mesh splitting and resolves a key issue affecting animation curves in malformed FBX files. A core class renaming improves long-term code clarity and extension possibilities.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **GLB Deformer Import**: Load deformers within `.glb` files and preserve animation integrity.
- **Morph Target Triangulation**: `TriMesh` now fully supports morph positions and normals for animation blending.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Mesh Split + Deformer Retention**: Mesh splitting now retains deformer metadata.
- **IO Extension Refactoring**: `IOUtils` class has been renamed to `IOExtension` for clearer utility function classification.

### üõ† Fix

- **FBX Curve Fix**: Fixed `System.InvalidOperationException` from malformed animation curves in `.fbx` files.

#### üö® API Changes

- üîÅ **Renamed Class**:  
  `Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities.IOUtils` ‚Üí `Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities.IOExtension`
