# Custom `XFORM` Operator Support

Added the custom `xform` operator support in USD / USDZ importer.

# Improved 3D Model FBX to USDZ Conversion

Previously the Models converted from FBX to USDZ were turning out to be all black. This issue has been resolved within the current release of the API.

# Improved Material Attributes Export

Material attributes were not being exported when no texture was attached. This issue has now been resolved.
