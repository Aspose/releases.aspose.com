By downloading the MSI installer of Aspose.3D for .NET 24.3, developers can easily integrate refined mesh optimization, versatile file system creation methods, and enhanced FBX import capabilities into their C# 3D apps.

### Enhanced Mesh Optimization

Experience greater control over tolerance levels for control points, normals, and UVs, enabling efficient memory usage with the new `Mesh.Optimize` method.

### FBX Compatible Mode

.NET developers can rely on Aspose.3D for .NET API to reconstruct PBR materials from FBX files with non-standard definitions and expand import capabilities.

### Versatile File System APIs

The latest update to the C# 3D apps API enables the creation of local, memory-based, or dummy file systems for streamlined file operations. The following code example highlights this functionality in C#:

```c#

    var inputFile = "input.fbx";
    var format = FileFormat.Detect(inputFile);
    //create a load options instance and specify a local file system
    var opt = format.CreateLoadOptions();
    opt.FileSystem = FileSystem.CreateLocalFileSystem("textures/");
    //load the file
    var scene = Scene.FromFile(inputFile, opt);

```

### Changes to the Public API

We have introduced various new API members and removed a few others to enhance the overall user experience and stability for .NET developers.
