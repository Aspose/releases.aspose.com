# Improved Large Mesh in U3D/PDF Export

Improved the large mesh in the U3D / PDF file exporting.

# Simplified 3D Scene Merging

Simplified the functions for merging scenes via API. This new method allows the merging of everything from another node to the current node.

```csharp
var scene1 = Scene.FromFile("file1");
var scene2 = Scene.FromFile("file2");
scene1.RootNode.Merge(scene2.RootNode);
scene1.Save("output.fbx", FileFormat.FBX7700Binary);
```
