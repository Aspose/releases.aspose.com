# Encode / Decode Light

This version of the 3D API allows encoding and decoding of the directional light as well as spot light.

# Improvements in 3D Cylinder Handling

The following issues have been resolved within this release:

- **THREEDNET-1294** Cylinder defined UV but no data
- **THREEDNET-1306** Cylinder with radius top =0 will generate incorrect model

# Convert from `DXF` to `gltf`/`glb`

Ability to convert a `DXF` file into `gltf` or `glb` formats. glTF (GL Transmission Format) is used as a standard file format to work with 3D scenes and models.

Please note that a `glTF` file can either have `gltf` or `glb` file extension.
