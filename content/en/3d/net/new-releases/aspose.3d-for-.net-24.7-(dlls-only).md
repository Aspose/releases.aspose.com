Aspose.3D for .NET 24.8 (DLLs only) focuses on enhancing 3D file processing capabilities across Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms. This version provides refined support for Siemens JT 10 files and adds a new compression codec for JT 9 files.

### Enhanced JT 10 Parsing

The .NET 3D API brings refactored Siemens JT version 10 parsing support to improve compatibility and functionality with complex 3D models used in industrial applications.

### New `Float64` Compression Codec

We have introduced a new `Float64` CDP compression codec for Siemens JT 9 files in the newest Aspose.3D for .NET release to ascertain quicker file processing while preserving data integrity for high-precision projects.
