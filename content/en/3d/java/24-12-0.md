# What's new in the Aspose.3D for Java 24.12

## Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for Java 24.12 concludes the year with a class renaming update and reiterates support for advanced animation features introduced in 24.11. It finalizes internal API refinements for deformers, morph targets, and mesh operations, improving consistency across import/export workflows.

## Enhancements

- **Deformer Support for GLB**  
  Ensures deformers are consistently retained and exported in GLB files.

- **Morph Target Triangulation in `TriMesh`**  
  TriMesh can now process morph position and normal data while triangulating models.

- **Preserve Deformers While Splitting Meshes**  
  Deformer data is retained when dividing complex geometries.

## Bug Fixes

- **Fix for Malformed FBX Animation Curves**  
  Addressed `InvalidOperationException` related to corrupted FBX animation curves during import.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Renamed Class**  
  - `Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities.IOUtils` → `Aspose.ThreeD.Utilities.IOExtension`  
    This rename reflects clearer naming consistency for utility methods used in input/output operations.
