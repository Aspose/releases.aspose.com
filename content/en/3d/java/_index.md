## Get Started

Aspose.3D Java APIs are hosted at the [Aspose Repository](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/java/). You can easily use Aspose.3D for Java API directly in your Maven projects with simple configurations. For the detailed instructions please visit [Installing Aspose.3D for Java from Aspose Repository](https://docs.aspose.com/3d/java/installation/) documentation page.

## Perform Linear Extrusion using Java API

``` java
RectangleShape profile = new RectangleShape();
profile.setRoundingRadius(0.3);
// perform Linear extrusion by passing a 2D shape as input and extend the shape in the 3rd dimension
LinearExtrusion extrusion = new LinearExtrusion(profile, 10) {{ setSlices(100); setCenter(true); setTwist(360); setTwistOffset(new Vector3(10, 0, 0));}};
extrusion.setSlices(100);
extrusion.setCenter(true);
extrusion.setTwist(360);
extrusion.setTwistOffset(new Vector3(10, 0, 0));
// create a scene
Scene scene = new Scene();
// create a child node by passing extrusion
scene.getRootNode().createChildNode(extrusion);
// save 3D scene
scene.save("output.obj", FileFormat.WAVEFRONTOBJ);
```
