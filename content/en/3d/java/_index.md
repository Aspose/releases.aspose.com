{{< repository/extract-package-explore-link imgsrc=/res_repo/img/compress/aspose_3d-for-java-banner.png >}}

[Product Page](https://products.aspose.com/3d/java) | [Docs](https://docs.aspose.com/3d/java/) | [Demos](https://products.aspose.app/3d/family) | [API Reference](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/java) | [Examples](https://github.com/aspose-3d/Aspose.3D-for-Java) | [Blog](https://blog.aspose.com/category/3d/) | [Search](https://search.aspose.com/) | [Free Support](https://forum.aspose.com/c/3d) | [Temporary License](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license)

[Aspose.3D for Java API](https://products.aspose.com/3d/java) is built to create, edit, manipulate and save 3D formats. It empowers Java applications to connect with 3D documents without installing any software package on the computer. Aspose.3D for Java API assist developers to model and create massive worlds in games, superb scenes for design visualization, and engage virtual reality experiences. The API is user friendly and saves time and money than creating a similar solution from scratch.

## 3D File Processing Features

- Work with 3D models and 3D objects.
- Setup target camera in 3D document.
- Add Node hierarchy and Share Geometric data of Mesh among Multiple Nodes of 3D Scene.
- Create 3D Mesh and expose Geometric Transformation.
- Convert all Polygons to Triangles in 3D Model.
- Work with [linear extrusion](https://docs.aspose.com/3d/java/working-with-linear-extrusion/), [cylinder](https://docs.aspose.com/3d/java/working-with-cylinder/), and [PointCloud](https://docs.aspose.com/3d/java/working-with-pointcloud/).

## Supported Environments

- **Microsoft Windows:** Windows Desktop & Server (x86, x64)
- **macOS:** Mac OS X
- **Linux:** Ubuntu, CentOS, and others
- **Java Versions:** `J2SE 9.0 (1.9+)` or above (for example Java 11)

## Get Started

Aspose.3D Java APIs are hosted at the [Aspose Repository](https://releases.aspose.com/3d/java/). You can easily use Aspose.3D for Java API directly in your Maven projects with simple configurations. For the detailed instructions please visit [Installing Aspose.3D for Java from Aspose Repository](https://docs.aspose.com/3d/java/installation/) documentation page.

## Perform Linear Extrusion using Java API

``` java
RectangleShape profile = new RectangleShape();
profile.setRoundingRadius(0.3);
// perform Linear extrusion by passing a 2D shape as input and extend the shape in the 3rd dimension
LinearExtrusion extrusion = new LinearExtrusion(profile, 10) {{ setSlices(100); setCenter(true); setTwist(360); setTwistOffset(new Vector3(10, 0, 0));}};
extrusion.setSlices(100);
extrusion.setCenter(true);
extrusion.setTwist(360);
extrusion.setTwistOffset(new Vector3(10, 0, 0));
// create a scene
Scene scene = new Scene();
// create a child node by passing extrusion
scene.getRootNode().createChildNode(extrusion);
// save 3D scene
scene.save("output.obj", FileFormat.WAVEFRONTOBJ);
```
