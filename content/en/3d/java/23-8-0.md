# What's new in the Aspose.3D for Java 23.8

## Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for Java 23.8 introduces an enhanced triangulation algorithm designed to handle super complex polygons more accurately. This update increases reliability in converting complex polygonal shapes into triangle meshes for downstream 3D operations.

## Enhancements

- **Improved Triangulation for Complex Polygons**  
  Implemented a new algorithm that improves the robustness and precision of polygon triangulation, especially for highly detailed or non-convex shapes.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

No changes to Public API or backward compatibility in this release.
