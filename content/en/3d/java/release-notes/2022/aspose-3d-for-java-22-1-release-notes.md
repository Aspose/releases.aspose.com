## API changes ##


In the 22.1 we've fixed some bugs in FBX and USD, and added primitive export/export to USD.

USD only support a few primitives like Sphere, Cube, Cylinder, we export other primitives through USD's customData, then USD scenes converted from CAD files like RVM can have much smaller file size.

And in 22.1 the web renderer can support USDZ file directly without converting to A3DW format now.


### Added class Aspose.ThreeD.Formats.UsdSaveOptions

UsdSaveOptions allow you to specify how to treat the primitives during the export, convert it to mesh for best compatibility or save them as parameterized geometries for smallest file size, our web renderer supports the parameterized geometries exported by Aspose.3D USDZ exporter, it's a best option for you to present 3D content using our web renderer.

    var scene = new Scene();
    scene.getRootNode().createChildNode(new Cylinder());
    var opt = new UsdSaveOptions(FileFormat.USDZ);
    //default value is true for back compatibility, set it to false so we can generate smaller usdz file.
    opt.setPrimitiveToMesh(false);
    scene.save("test.usdz", opt);
