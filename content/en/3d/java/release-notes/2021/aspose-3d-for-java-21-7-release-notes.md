## API changes ##



### Added USDZ as export type ###

From 21.7 you can export scene into USDZ by:

{{< highlight java >}}
    Scene scene = new Scene();
    //...prepare your scene
    scene.Save("test.usdz", FileFormat.USDZ);
{{< /highlight >}}


### Added class com.aspose.threed.FileSystemFactory ###


{{< highlight java >}}
    /**
    * {@link com.aspose.threed.SaveOptions} and {@link com.aspose.threed.LoadOptions} will create a {@link com.aspose.threed.LocalFileSystem} for default.
    * This can be a security issue in server environment.
    * Use your own {@link com.aspose.threed.FileSystemFactory} to {@link com.aspose.threed.IOConfig#getFileSystemFactory} to improve server side security.
    */
    public interface FileSystemFactory
    {    
        FileSystem call();
        
    }
{{< /highlight >}}


### Added new property FileSystemFactory to com.aspose.threed.IOConfig:


{{< highlight java >}}
    /**
     * Gets the factory class for FileSystem.
     * The default factory will create {@link com.aspose.threed.LocalFileSystem} which is not suitable for server environment.
     */
    public static FileSystemFactory getFileSystemFactory();
    
    /**
     * Sets the factory class for FileSystem.
     * The default factory will create {@link com.aspose.threed.LocalFileSystem} which is not suitable for server environment.
     * @param value New value
     */
    public static void setFileSystemFactory(FileSystemFactory value);

{{< /highlight>}}



It could be dangerous if the user made a malicious 3D file and uploaded the content to your server, the new FileSystemFactory allows you to specify your own implementation of FileSystem to replace the original LocalFileSystem which may read your sensitive data during exporting a 3D file.







### Added new property to com.aspose.threed.FileFormat:

{{< highlight java >}}
    /**
     * Gets whether Aspose.3D supports export scene to current file format.
     */
    public boolean getCanExport();
    
    /**
     * Gets whether Aspose.3D supports import scene from current file format.
     */
    public boolean getCanImport();

{{< /highlight >}}

You can test if a file format supports import or export through these properties.
