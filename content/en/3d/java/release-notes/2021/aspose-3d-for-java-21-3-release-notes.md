## API changes ##


This version is mainly a bug-fix version, fixed a lot of bugs, and improved a lot of compatibility for FBX, Collada, DirectX X files.


Only a few minor API changes.

### Added new data type in class `com.aspose.threed.VertexFieldDataType`:

{{< highlight java >}}

    /**
     * Type of byte[4], can be used to represent color with less memory consumption.
     */
    public static final int BYTE_VECTOR4;

{{< /highlight >}}

The VertexElementVertexColor in com.aspose.threed.Geometry will be encoded as a 4 bytes integer with type VertexFieldDataType.BYTE_VECTOR4.

This can reduce the final generated file a lot in glTF/glb that used vertex color, very useful for encoding point clouds.

And from this version, the com.aspose.threed.PointCloud is supported in glTF/glb open and save.



### Added members to class `com.aspose.threed.BoundingBox`


{{< highlight java >}}

    /**
     * The size of the bounding box
     */
    public Vector3 getSize();
  
    /**
     * The center of the bounding box.
     */
    public Vector3 getCenter();

{{< /highlight >}}

Now it's easier to get the size and center of the bounding box, these properties only make sense when the BoundingBox is finite.
