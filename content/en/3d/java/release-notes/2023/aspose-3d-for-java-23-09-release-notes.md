### API Changes


#### Added members to class **com.aspose.threed.BoundingBox**:

{{< highlight java >}}
    /**
     * Calculates the absolute largest coordinate value of any contained point.
     */
    public double scale()

    /**
     * Merge current bounding box with given point
     * @param pt 
     */
    public void merge(com.aspose.threed.Vector4 pt)

    /**
     * Merge current bounding box with given point
     * @param pt 
     */
    public void merge(com.aspose.threed.Vector3 pt)

    /**
     * Merge current bounding box with given point
     */
    public void merge(double x, double y, double z)

    /**
     * Merges the new box into the current bounding box.
     * @param bb 
     */
    public void merge(com.aspose.threed.BoundingBox bb)

    /**
     * Check if current bounding box overlaps with specified bounding box.
     * @param box The other bounding box to test
     */
    public bool overlapsWith(com.aspose.threed.BoundingBox box)

    /**
     * Check if the point p is inside the bounding box
     * @param p The point to test
     */
    public bool contains(com.aspose.threed.Vector3 p)
