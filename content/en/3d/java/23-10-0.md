# What's new in the Aspose.3D for Java 23.10

## Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for Java 23.10 brings experimental support for Boolean mesh operations, empowering developers to perform union, difference, and intersection calculations on manifold tri-mesh geometries. This release also improves error visibility during trial mode and resolves System.Drawing-related migration concerns.

## New Features

- **Boolean Operations on Meshes (Experimental)**  
  New static methods in `Mesh` class allow performing Boolean operations (`union`, `difference`, `intersect`, and `doBoolean`) on two manifold meshes, with optional transformation matrices. Currently supported only for manifold tri-meshes.

## Enhancements

- **Trial Exception Logging**  
  Added console messaging when trial exceptions are suppressed, aiding in debugging and licensing transparency.

- **System.Drawing Migration Clarification**  
  Addressed support issues related to the removal of `System.Drawing` dependency in newer versions, helping ease migration for affected users.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Updated Class: `com.aspose.threed.Mesh`**  
  - `public static Mesh doBoolean(BooleanOperation op, Mesh a, Matrix4 transformA, Mesh b, Matrix4 transformB)`  
  - `public static Mesh union(Mesh a, Mesh b)`  
  - `public static Mesh difference(Mesh a, Mesh b)`  
  - `public static Mesh intersect(Mesh a, Mesh b)`  

  These methods allow geometric operations between two meshes. Input meshes must be manifold for accurate results.
