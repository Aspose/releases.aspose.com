# What's new in the Aspose.3D for Java 24.8

## Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for Java 24.8 introduces powerful utilities for axis system transformation, exposes JT file metadata and PMI support, and improves internal file format handling. The update also resolves key bugs affecting GLB model rotation and 3MF compatibility.

## New Features

- **JT Metadata and PMI Support via `JtLoadOptions`**  
  Load JT file properties and PMI (Product Manufacturing Information) into Aspose.3D property structures using new `JtLoadOptions`.

- **Axis System Conversion Utilities**  
  New methods in `AxisSystem` and `PolygonModifier` allow transforming geometries between coordinate systems via matrix conversion.

## Enhancements

- **Full XZ Stream Support Implemented**  
  Improved internal streaming support to handle advanced stream cases across supported file formats.

- **JT 9.5 Metadata Enhancements**  
  Added better parsing and property extraction for Siemens JT 9.5 format.

## Bug Fixes

- **GLB Model Rotation Errors**  
  Fixed incorrect rotation transformations applied to GLB models during conversion.

- **3MF File Load Failure**  
  Resolved a bug where certain 3MF files would fail to open due to internal data issues.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Class: `JtLoadOptions`**
  - `getLoadProperties()` / `setLoadProperties(boolean)`  
  - `getLoadPMI()` / `setLoadPMI(boolean)`  
  Enables import of JT properties and PMI as part of scene data.

- **Updated Class: `AxisSystem`**
  - `transformTo(AxisSystem targetSystem)` — Generates a transform matrix between axis systems.
  - `fromAssetInfo(AssetInfo assetInfo)` — Constructs axis system from scene metadata.

- **Updated Class: `PolygonModifier`**
  - `applyTransform(Node node, Matrix4 transform)` — Applies matrix transformations to all geometry control points.
