# What's new in the Aspose.3D for Java 24.9

## Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for Java 24.9 introduces full support for exporting 3MF models with textures and thumbnails, along with the ability to import Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) files. It also adds internal property enhancements, refines axis system utilities, and cleans up deprecated APIs related to legacy file systems and animation.

## New Features

- **3MF Export with Texture and Thumbnail Support**  
  Added `Microsoft3MFFormat` and `Microsoft3MFSaveOptions` to control advanced export options, including scene buildability, embedded textures, and thumbnails.

- **IFC Import Support**  
  IFC files can now be loaded into the scene, expanding support for BIM (Building Information Modeling) workflows.

## Enhancements

- **Expose Internal Axis System Utilities**  
  Axis system transformation utilities remain accessible, enabling consistent coordinate handling during import/export.

- **Extended Property Flags and Extra Data**  
  Properties now support additional metadata and flags to enhance scene semantics and flexibility.

## Bug Fixes

- **MetadataDecoder NotImplemented Exception**  
  Resolved a missing implementation in the metadata handling pipeline, improving robustness.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Classes**  
  - `com.aspose.threed.Microsoft3MFFormat`  
  - `com.aspose.threed.Microsoft3MFSaveOptions`

- **Removed Classes (by schedule)**  
  - `DummyFileSystem`  
  - `LocalFileSystem`  
  - `MemoryFileSystem`  
  - `ZipArchiveFileSystem`

- **Removed Members from `AnimationChannel`**  
  - `addKeyframeSequence(KeyframeSequence)`  
  - `getName()`  
  - `getKeyframeSequences()`

- **Removed Member from `BindPoint`**  
  - `getKeyframeSequences(String channelName)`
