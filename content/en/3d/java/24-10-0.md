# What's new in the Aspose.3D for Java 24.10

## Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for Java 24.10 enhances procedural modeling with a new `CenterLineProfile`, expands IFC Boolean operation support, and significantly improves IFC import reliability. This release also fixes transformation and mesh generation bugs in IFC workflows and adds Blender import support for previously unsupported geometry data.

## New Features

- **CenterLineProfile for Procedural Modeling**  
  A new `CenterLineProfile` class enables adding thickness to a curve path—ideal for generating extruded or swept geometry using tools like `LinearExtrusion`.

## Enhancements

- **IFC Boolean Operation Support**  
  Boolean operations are now supported during IFC import, allowing for accurate representation of solids generated via constructive geometry.

- **Improved IFC Compatibility**  
  Enhanced internal handling for a wider range of IFC entity types and complex geometry cases.

## Bug Fixes

- **Incorrect Transformation of IFC Scenes**  
  Fixed inaccurate scene placement when importing models with transformation matrices from IFC files.

- **Mesh Generation for `IfcRevolvedAreaSolid`**  
  Corrected geometry output from revolved area solids in IFC files.

- **Unsupported bGPdata in Blender Files**  
  Addressed import failures due to unresolved or unsupported array data structures in `.blend` files.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Class: `com.aspose.threed.CenterLineProfile`**  
  Allows developers to assign thickness to curves for downstream use in mesh extrusion or procedural modeling.
