# What's new in the Aspose.3D for Java 25.3

## Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for Java 25.3 brings powerful new modeling capabilities including support for Boolean operations, virtual half-space entities, and advanced boundary representation (B-Rep). This release also improves geometry reliability and resolves key bugs related to GLTF/OBJ conversion, NURBS tessellation, and mesh manifold validity.

## New Features

- **Boolean Modeling System**  
  Introduced `BooleanOperand` and `BooleanOperator` classes for performing Boolean operations on 3D solids using mesh or analytical geometry.

- **Virtual Entity HalfSpace Support**  
  Added `HalfSpace` entity support to represent infinite planar clipping geometry for advanced CSG operations.

- **Advanced B-Rep Support**  
  Enhanced modeling capabilities with advanced B-Rep structures for high-precision CAD-style modeling.

## Enhancements

- **NURBS Curve Degree Property**  
  `NurbsCurve` now exposes a `getDegree()`/`setDegree()` API for better control and consistency with standard spline definitions.

- **ArbitraryProfile Holes Support**  
  Added ability to define internal holes within arbitrary profiles using closed curves.

- **SonarQube-Detected Critical Fixes**  
  Addressed code quality and safety issues based on SonarQube analysis.

## Bug Fixes

- **GLTF to OBJ Conversion Issues**  
  Fixed data integrity issues during conversion between glTF and OBJ formats.

- **B-Spline Tessellation Failure**  
  Resolved NURBS-based curve rendering and tessellation problems.

- **Advanced B-Rep Mesh Boolean Compatibility**  
  Fixed issue preventing B-Rep generated meshes from being used in Boolean operations.

- **Linear Extrusion Manifold Issues**  
  Ensured that meshes generated via linear extrusion are manifold and suitable for export/CSG.

- **GLB Animation Validation Errors**  
  Fixed export bugs causing GLB files with animations to fail glTF schema validation.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Classes**  
  - `Aspose.ThreeD.Entities.BooleanOperand`  
  - `Aspose.ThreeD.Entities.BooleanOperator`  
  - `Aspose.ThreeD.Entities.HalfSpace`

- **Updated Class: `NurbsCurve`**  
  - `getDegree()` / `setDegree(int)` — Separates spline degree from order.

- **Updated Class: `ArbitraryProfile`**  
  - `getHoles()` — Define inner holes using closed curves.
