# What's new in the Aspose.3D for Java 24.3

## Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for Java 24.3 focuses on enhanced mesh optimization and greater flexibility in file I/O operations. The release also improves FBX-to-glTF conversion with better support for PBR material properties and introduces configurable compatibility for Blender-style exports.

## New Features

- **Tolerance-Controlled Mesh Optimization**  
  A new `optimize()` method lets developers fine-tune tolerance levels for control points, normals, and UVs during memory optimization.

- **Virtual File System Utilities**  
  Added `FileSystem` utilities to support loading/saving from memory, local folders, dummy FS, or ZIP streams—ideal for sandboxed or cloud environments.

## Enhancements

- **FBX Compatible Mode for Blender PBR Materials**  
  `FbxLoadOptions.setCompatibleMode(true)` reconstructs PBR material data exported from Blender’s non-standard FBX structure.

- **Expanded Code Samples**  
  Added new code examples across multiple APIs to improve adoption and implementation clarity.

## Bug Fixes

- **Mesh Distortion After Optimization**  
  Resolved mesh deformation issues caused by aggressive optimization settings in previous versions.

- **Flat Geometry from SweptAreaSolid**  
  Corrected flat mesh output when using `SweptAreaSolid` for 3D solid generation.

- **Missing Roughness/Metallic Maps in FBX→glTF**  
  Fixed PBR texture loss during FBX to glTF conversion, ensuring complete material export.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Updated Class: `Mesh`**  
  - `public Mesh optimize(boolean vertexElements, float toleranceControlPoint, float toleranceNormal, float toleranceUV)`  
    Allows tolerance control over point merging to avoid geometry loss.

- **Updated Class: `FbxLoadOptions`**  
  - `getCompatibleMode()` / `setCompatibleMode(boolean)`  
    Enables support for reconstructing Blender-style PBR materials during FBX load.

- **New Class: `FileSystem` Utilities**  
  - `createLocalFileSystem(String directory)`  
  - `createMemoryFileSystem(Map<String, MemoryStream>)`  
  - `createDummyFileSystem()`  
  - `createZipFileSystem(...)`  
    Allows flexible file source mapping for scene and texture loading.
