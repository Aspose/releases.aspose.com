# What's new in the Aspose.3D for Java 23.6

## Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for Java 23.6 introduces experimental support for IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) versions 2x3 and 4. This update also resolves bugs in font rendering, STL polygon preservation, and IFC transformation accuracy—laying the groundwork for broader BIM format integration.

## New Features

- **Experimental Support for IFC Files**  
  Added initial support for reading IFC 2x3 and IFC 4 files, enabling early access to BIM data handling. More improvements are planned in future releases.

## Bug Fixes

- **CascadiaCode Font Not Supported**  
  Resolved an issue that prevented using CascadiaCode in procedural text rendering.

- **Incorrect IFC 2x3 Transformations**  
  Fixed errors in spatial transformations when loading IFC 2x3 files.

- **STL Polygon Loss on Reload**  
  Addressed a bug where polygonal data was lost after saving and reloading STL files.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Updated Class: `com.aspose.threed.FileFormat`**  
  - Added new static member:  
    ```java
    public static final FileFormat IFC;
    ```
  - Description: Represents the ISO 16739-1 Industry Foundation Classes data model format.
