# What's new in the Aspose.3D for Java 23.12

## Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for Java 23.12 introduces advanced geometry and export controls, including mesh optimization, complex Boolean operations, and axis system configuration for STL, OBJ, and PLY exports. This version also includes enhancements for animation binding and FBX compatibility, along with critical texture and format-specific bug fixes.

## New Features

- **Optimize Mesh Memory Usage**  
  New `optimize()` method removes duplicate control points and vertex data to reduce mesh size and memory consumption.

- **Axis System Support for Export Formats**  
  OBJ, STL, and PLY exports now allow setting custom `AxisSystem` (e.g., up vector, front vector) via `SaveOptions`.

- **Complex Boolean Operations on Meshes**  
  Added support for robust Boolean operations (`union`, `difference`, `intersect`) on general (non-manifold) meshes.

## Enhancements

- **Boolean Operations on Ordinal Meshes**  
  Improved internal Boolean logic to handle regular non-manifold meshes more reliably.

- **Enhanced Animation Binding**  
  The `findBindPoint()` method in `AnimationNode` now supports searching by both target and name for precision.

## Bug Fixes

- **OBJ Export Texture Issues**  
  Resolved incorrect texture references when exporting to OBJ.

- **GLTF Export Texture Issues**  
  Fixed similar texture mapping problems in glTF exports.

- **FBX Model Grouping Bug**  
  Corrected improper grouping structure when exporting to FBX.

- **GPU Memory Allocation Failure (8192x8192 Textures)**  
  Fixed a crash during texture handling with very large images.

- **Incompatible Animation Data Output**  
  Resolved issues generating animation data incompatible with target environments.

- **Incorrect Object Binding Behavior**  
  Fixed binding logic where identical property names caused ambiguity across objects.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Class**:  
  - `com.aspose.threed.AxisSystem` — Define coordinate system, up/front vectors for export.

- **Renamed Class**:  
  - `CoordinatedSystem` → `CoordinateSystem`

- **Updated Classes and Members**:
  - `Mesh`:  
    - `public Mesh optimize(boolean vertexElements)`
  - `ObjSaveOptions`, `PlySaveOptions`, `StlSaveOptions`:  
    - `getAxisSystem()` / `setAxisSystem(...)`
  - `AssetInfo`:  
    - `getFrontVector()` / `setFrontVector(...)`  
    - `getAxisSystem()` / `setAxisSystem(...)`
  - `Axis` enum:  
    - Added: `NEGATIVE_X_AXIS`, `NEGATIVE_Y_AXIS`, `NEGATIVE_Z_AXIS`
  - `Bone`:  
    - `getLinkMode()` / `setLinkMode(BoneLinkMode)`
  - `Transform`:  
    - Added support for `Scaling`, `ScalingOffset`, `RotationOffset`, enhancing Maya/3ds Max compatibility.
  - `AnimationNode`:  
    - `findBindPoint(A3DObject target, String name)`
