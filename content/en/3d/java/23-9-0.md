# What's new in the Aspose.3D for Java 23.9

## Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for Java 23.9 introduces new geometric operations in the `BoundingBox` API, enabling spatial checks and merge logic. This release also resolves several critical bugs including mesh triangulation, bump texture preservation, and watermark rendering.

## Enhancements

- **Migration Preparation to System.Numerics**  
  Internal refactoring initiated for future integration with `System.Numerics`-style numerical types to enhance performance and compatibility.

## Bug Fixes

- **Watermark Not Displayed on Some Meshes**  
  Fixed rendering inconsistency causing watermarks to be skipped on certain geometries.

- **Generic Conversion Issues**  
  Resolved an internal conversion bug affecting compatibility across formats.

- **Bump Texture Loss in FBX to OBJ Conversion**  
  Fixed issue where bump maps were not preserved when exporting FBX to OBJ.

- **Mesh Triangulation Failures**  
  Improved stability of the triangulation algorithm to prevent occasional failures.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Updated Class: `com.aspose.threed.BoundingBox`**  
  - `public double scale()` – Returns the largest coordinate value of the bounding box.  
  - `public void merge(Vector3 pt)` – Merges the bounding box with a point.  
  - `public void merge(Vector4 pt)`  
  - `public void merge(double x, double y, double z)`  
  - `public void merge(BoundingBox bb)` – Expands bounding box to include another.  
  - `public boolean overlapsWith(BoundingBox box)` – Checks for intersection with another bounding box.  
  - `public boolean contains(Vector3 p)` – Tests whether a point lies within the bounding box.
