# What's new in the Aspose.3D for Java 24.5

## Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for Java 24.5 focuses on improving reliability and compatibility with Blender and Siemens JT 9.5 files. This release resolves multiple Blender import issues, including skeletons, deform animations, and nested textures, while also improving LOD and compressed vertex color handling in JT files. A new `Scene.Version` field has been added for runtime version tracking.

## Enhancements

- **Watermark Protection Improvement**  
  Watermarks protected by a password can no longer be overwritten by users, ensuring stronger content integrity.

## Bug Fixes

- **Blender Import Fixes**  
  - Fixed nested texture import errors.  
  - Resolved issues importing Blender skeletons and deform animations.  
  - Enabled Blender file import via `MemoryStream`.

- **JT 9.5 Compatibility Fixes**  
  - Fixed decoding of compressed vertex color arrays without quantization.  
  - Resolved loading failures in `TopoMesh` compressed LOD data.  
  - Improved general support for problematic JT 9.5 files.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Updated Class: `Scene`**  
  - Added static field:  
    ```java
    public static final String Version;
    ```  
    Provides access to the current Aspose.3D assembly version at runtime.
