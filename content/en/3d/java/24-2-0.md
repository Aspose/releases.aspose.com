# What's new in the Aspose.3D for Java 24.2

## Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for Java 24.2 introduces native support for `InputStream` and `OutputStream` in Scene I/O operations, simplifying integration into Java-based workflows. The release also includes a new API for mesh triangulation and TriMesh streaming, along with important format upgrades and bug fixes across glTF, FBX, USD, and 3MF pipelines.

## Enhancements

- **Native InputStream/OutputStream Support for Scene I/O**  
  New overloads allow loading and saving 3D scenes directly via `InputStream` and `OutputStream`, streamlining file handling in modern Java apps.

- **Improved Handling of Large Vertex OBJ → GLTF Conversions**  
  Optimized memory and vertex processing to support high-density meshes during OBJ to glTF export.

- **.NET 8.0 Support Upgrade**  
  Internals updated to align with .NET 8.0, ensuring future compatibility for shared cross-platform components.

## Bug Fixes

- **Skeleton Node Missing Transforms in FBX Export**  
  Fixed export bug where skeleton nodes had pose data but lacked proper transformation matrices.

- **KHR_mesh_quantization in glTF Import**  
  Added support for the KHR extension to ensure proper attribute decoding during glTF import.

- **GLB to FBX Animation Export Fails with Slerp Error**  
  Resolved failure in quaternion interpolation (slerp) during animation conversion.

- **Maya Importer Crash on Unknown Attributes**  
  Fixed issue where unsupported attributes could terminate the import process.

- **USD Load Failure on Invalid Primitive Property**  
  Prevented loader crash when encountering primitives missing valid property values.

- **3MF External Reference Bug in Build Elements**  
  Corrected handling of external part references in 3MF build sections.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Updated Class: `Mesh`**  
  - `public Mesh triangulate()` — Automatically triangulates non-triangular meshes.

- **Updated Class: `TriMesh`**  
  - `addTriangle(int a, int b, int c)` — Allows manual triangle creation.  
  - `writeVerticesTo(OutputStream stream)`  
  - `write16bIndicesTo(OutputStream stream)`  
  - `write32bIndicesTo(OutputStream stream)`

- **Updated Class: `Scene`**  
  - Numerous `fromStream(...)`, `open(...)`, and `save(...)` methods added to support Java-native `InputStream` and `OutputStream`, with optional format, options, and cancellation token support.
