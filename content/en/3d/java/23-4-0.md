# What's new in the Aspose.3D for Java 23.4

## Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for Java 23.4 introduces major architectural improvements by removing the System.Drawing dependency and replacing it with platform-neutral types. It also enhances OBJ export with support for PBR material definitions, texture copying, and expands the API for advanced texture manipulation and pixel mapping.

## New Features

- **Texture Codec and Pixel Mapping Support**  
  Introduced new classes such as `ITextureCodec`, `PixelMapping`, and `PixelMapMode` for external texture encoding/decoding and direct pixel manipulation in memory.

- **Pixel Format Transformation**  
  Added capability to transform a texture’s pixel layout using `transformPixelFormat`.

## Enhancements

- **Export Textures with OBJ**  
  Added a new property `exportTextures` in `SaveOptions` to allow copying texture files alongside OBJ output.

- **PBR Material and Normal Mapping in OBJ Export**  
  Improved material export to include physically based rendering (PBR) and normal maps in OBJ.

- **System.Drawing Decoupling**  
  Replaced usage of `java.awt` types with internal equivalents such as `Vector2`, `Vector3`, `Rect`, and `TextureData`.

## Bug Fixes

- **OBJ Export Missing Textures**  
  Fixed an issue where image and texture files were not being copied to the OBJ directory during export.

- **OBJ Loading Issues**  
  Resolved errors related to missing material/texture and incorrect handling of control points as normals.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Removed Classes**  
  - `com.aspose.threed.RenderingAPI`  
  - `com.aspose.threed.ShadingLanguage`  

- **Added Classes**  
  - `com.aspose.threed.ITextureCodec`  
  - `com.aspose.threed.ITextureDecoder`  
  - `com.aspose.threed.ITextureEncoder`  
  - `com.aspose.threed.TextureCodec`  
  - `com.aspose.threed.PixelMapMode`  
  - `com.aspose.threed.PixelMapping`  

- **Updated Classes**  
  - `com.aspose.threed.TextureData`  
    - `mapPixels(...)`, `transformPixelFormat(...)` methods added.  
    - Removed `fromBitmap(...)` and `toBitmap()` methods using `BufferedImage`.  

- **Updated SaveOptions API**  
  - Added `getExportTextures()` and `setExportTextures(boolean)` methods.
