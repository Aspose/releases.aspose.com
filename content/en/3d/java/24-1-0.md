# What's new in the Aspose.3D for Java 24.1

## Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for Java 24.1 introduces advanced animation and file format enhancements, including full support for quaternion-based and Euler-based animations in FBX and glTF. The release also improves 3MF format handling for assembled structures and resolves a wide range of compatibility and data integrity issues in USDZ, JT, and glTF workflows.

## New Features

- **Quaternion-Based Animation Export**  
  Now supports exporting animations driven by quaternion rotation to both FBX and glTF formats, enhancing smooth rotational transitions.

- **Keyframe Access via AnimationChannel**  
  New `getKeyframeSequence()` API provides a unified interface to retrieve or set keyframe sequences for animation channels.

## Enhancements

- **Convert Euler to Quaternion Animation**  
  Internal updates allow converting Euler angle-based animations to quaternion format.

- **Improved GLTF Animation Export**  
  Both Euler and quaternion-based rotation animations can now be reliably exported to glTF format.

- **3MF Assembled Structure Support**  
  Added support for exporting 3MF files that include hierarchical assemblies, increasing compatibility with 3D printing platforms.

- **Keyframe Resampling for Accurate Conversion**  
  Enhanced animation conversion pipeline now resamples keyframes when transitioning from quaternion to Euler format.

## Bug Fixes

- **JT 8.0 File Load Failure**  
  Resolved inability to load `.JT` files from version 8.0 into scenes.

- **NaN Quaternion Rotations**  
  Fixed quaternion calculation bug that could result in NaN rotation values.

- **Corrupted Texture Coordinates in GLTF**  
  Addressed data corruption issue when resaving glTF models with textures.

- **Undetected GLTF Formats**  
  Improved format detection logic for edge-case glTF files.

- **Exception on Incomplete Keyframe Sequences in GLTF**  
  Prevented export crashes due to missing or incomplete keyframe sequences.

- **USDZ/GLTF Export Fails for Negative Material Index**  
  Fixed an issue where meshes with negative material indices failed during export.

- **USDZ Infinity Value Handling**  
  Exporter now safely handles `-inf` and `inf` values in USDZ format.

- **USDZ Incompatibility with THREE.js Exporter**  
  Enhanced parser to correctly open USDZ files generated by THREE.js tools.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Updated Class: `AnimationChannel`**  
  - `getKeyframeSequence()` / `setKeyframeSequence(KeyframeSequence)`  
    - Provides structured access to animation keyframe sequences. Existing interfaces will be deprecated in the future.

- **Updated Class: `Quaternion`**  
  - `public static Quaternion slerp(double t, Quaternion v1, Quaternion v2)`  
    - Adds support for spherical linear interpolation between quaternions (SLERP).
