# What's new in the Aspose.3D for Java 24.11

## Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for Java 24.11 improves animation and morph target support in 3D pipelines. The release introduces deformer support in GLB, enables morph target triangulation in `TriMesh`, and ensures deformers are retained when splitting meshes. A critical fix resolves malformed FBX animation curve definitions that previously caused import failures.

## Enhancements

- **GLB Deformer Support Added**  
  Deformers used for animations or shape keys are now preserved and processed correctly in GLB workflows.

- **Morph Target Triangulation in TriMesh**  
  Enhanced `TriMesh` to handle morph position and morph normal data when triangulating geometry with morph targets.

- **Preserve Deformers on Mesh Splitting**  
  When a mesh is split, its associated deformers are now retained for accurate post-processing and animation.

## Bug Fixes

- **Malformed FBX Animation Curve Handling**  
  Fixed an `InvalidOperationException` caused by invalid animation curve definitions in certain FBX files.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Updated Class: `VertexFieldSemantic`**  
  - `public static final VertexFieldSemantic MorphPosition`  
  - `public static final VertexFieldSemantic MorphNormal`  
    These semantics support internal mapping of morph targets during geometry processing.
