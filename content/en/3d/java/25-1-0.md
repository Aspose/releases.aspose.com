# What's new in the Aspose.3D for Java 25.1

## Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for Java 25.1 brings significant improvements to glTF workflows with full animation and skinning import, and deform weight animation export. This release also resolves several critical issues related to Draco compression, mesh decoding, and morph target animation export.

## New Features

- **glTF Animation Import Support**  
  glTF files can now be imported with embedded animations, enabling more complete scene reconstruction from animated assets.

## Enhancements

- **glTF Skinning Import**  
  Added support for importing skinning data from glTF, preserving skeletal structures and weights.

- **Export Deform Weight Animation in glTF**  
  Enables exporting animations on deform weights (e.g., blend shapes) for glTF targets.

## Bug Fixes

- **DRC File Decoding Failure**  
  Fixed an issue where decoding of Draco-compressed (DRC) files failed during glTF loading.

- **Draco Compression Regression in glTF Exporter**  
  Resolved a regression bug that caused Draco compression to fail in glTF output.

- **Incorrect Draco Mesh Loaded from glTF**  
  Addressed issues with corrupted geometry when reading Draco-compressed meshes from glTF files.

- **FBX Export Fails for MorphTargetChannel.ChannelWeight Animation**  
  Fixed a bug preventing proper export of weight animations on morph target channels to FBX format.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

No changes to Public API or backward compatibility in this release.
