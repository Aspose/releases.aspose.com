# What's new in the Aspose.3D for Java 25.4

## Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for Java 25.4 introduces advanced support for reading and writing structured metadata in glTF files using Khronos extensions. It enables semantic 3D model workflows via `EXT_structural_metadata` and `EXT_mesh_features`, and improves compatibility with Ready Player Me-exported glTF content.

## New Features

- **glTF Metadata Export Using `EXT_mesh_features`**  
  Now supports exporting metadata-rich glTF files using the `EXT_mesh_features` extension to include structured feature data in the model.

## Enhancements

- **glTF Metadata Import via `EXT_structural_metadata`**  
  The new `StructuralMetadata` API allows parsing structured metadata associated with geometry, enhancing semantic interoperability for GIS, digital twin, and BIM scenarios.

## Bug Fixes

- **Ready Player Me glTF Compatibility**  
  Fixed import failure when loading glTF files generated by Ready Player Me, ensuring broader ecosystem support.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Classes in `com.aspose.threed.StructuralMetadata`**  
  - `StructuralMetadata`  
  - `ClassType`  
  - `EnumType`  
  - `EnumValue`  
  - `Property`  
  - `PropertyTable`  

  These classes enable reading and manipulating glTF structural metadata.
