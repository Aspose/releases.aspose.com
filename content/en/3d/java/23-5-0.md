# What's new in the Aspose.3D for Java 23.5

## Release Highlights

Aspose.3D for Java 23.5 introduces powerful new features for procedural modeling and export precision. This release adds 3D text generation using font files and allows applying unit scale factors during export to glTF, OBJ, and Draco formats. It also includes several bug fixes and compatibility improvements for OBJ handling.

## New Features

- **3D Text Generation via FontFile and Text**  
  New `FontFile` and `Text` classes allow creating text-based 3D profiles that can be extruded into meshes, enabling dynamic labeling, signage, or font-based geometry.

- **Apply Unit Scale Factor on Export**  
  Added `applyUnitScale` property to `GltfSaveOptions`, `ObjSaveOptions`, and `DracoSaveOptions` for exporting meshes scaled by `Scene.AssetInfo.UnitScaleFactor`.

## Enhancements

- **Export Textures and PBR Materials in OBJ**  
  Continued improvements in OBJ export, including support for PBR material definitions and copying of image/texture files to the output directory.

## Bug Fixes

- **OBJ Texture and Material Load Issues**  
  Fixed problems related to missing textures and materials when loading OBJ files.

- **Incorrect OBJ ControlPoints Parsing**  
  Resolved an issue where vertex control points were mistakenly interpreted as normal vectors during import.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Added Classes**  
  - `com.aspose.threed.FontFile`  
  - `com.aspose.threed.Text`  

- **Updated Classes**  
  - `com.aspose.threed.DracoSaveOptions`  
  - `com.aspose.threed.GltfSaveOptions`  
  - `com.aspose.threed.ObjSaveOptions`  
    - Added `getApplyUnitScale()` and `setApplyUnitScale(boolean)` methods to rescale meshes during export using `AssetInfo.UnitScaleFactor`.
