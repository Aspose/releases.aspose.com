## **Improvements and Changes**

|**Key**|**Summary**|**Category**|
| :- | :- | :- |
| THREEDNET-1514 | Write more code examples o cover more methods and types. | Task |
| THREEDNET-1523 | Optimize mesh causes distortion | Task |
| THREEDNET-1516 | Model generated by SweptAreaSolid should not be flat | Bug fixing |
| THREEDNET-1517 | Metallic map and roughness map are not present when I am converting fbx to glb | Bug fixing |


## API changes ##


### Added members to class **aspose.threed.entities.Mesh**:

{{< highlight python >}}
        def optimize(self : Mesh, vertexElements : bool, toleranceControlPoint : float, toleranceNormal : float, toleranceUV : float) -> Mesh
                """ Optimize the mesh's memory usage by eliminating duplicated control points """
{{< /highlight >}}

The new method allows you to control the tolerance for control point, normal and UV.


### Added members to class **aspose.threed.formats.FbxLoadOptions**:


{{< highlight python >}}
        @property
        def compatible_mode(self) -> bool:
                """Gets or sets whether to enable compatible mode.
                Compatible mode will try to support non-standard FBX definitions like PBR materials exported by Blender.
                Default value is false."""

        @compatible_mode.setter
        def compatible_mode(self, v : bool):
                """Gets or sets whether to enable compatible mode.
                Compatible mode will try to support non-standard FBX definitions like PBR materials exported by Blender.
                Default value is false."""

{{< /highlight >}}

FBX doesn't support PBR material, different exporter uses different definition for storing PBR material's parameters, this parameter allows you to reconstruct PBR material as much as possible.

### Added members to class **aspose.threed.utilities.FileSystem**:

{{< highlight csharp >}}

        @staticmethod
        def create_local_file_system(directory : str) -> FileSystem
                """Initialize a new <see cref="FileSystem"/> that only access local directory.
                All file read/write on this FileSystem instance will be mapped to specified directory. """

        @staticmethod
        def create_memory_file_system(files : Optional[dict[str, Bytes]]) -> FileSystem
                """Create a memory-based file system which will maps the read/write operations to memory."""

        @staticmethod
        def create_dummy_file_system() -> FileSystem
                """Create a dummy file system, read/write operations are dummy operations."""

        @staticmethod
        def create_zip_file_system(stream : IO.BufferedIOBase, baseDir : Optional[str]) -> FileSystem
                """Create a file system to provide to the read-only access to speicified zip file or zip stream.
                File system will be disposed after the open/save operation."""

        @staticmethod
        def create_zip_file_system(fileName : str) -> FileSystem
                """File system to provide to the read-only access to speicified zip file or zip stream.
                File system will be disposed after the open/save operation."""

{{< /highlight >}}


These methods provide quick ways to create built-in FileSystems for you.

**Sample code**:

{{< highlight python >}}
    inputFile = "input.fbx"
    format = FileFormat.detect(inputFile)
    # create a load options instance and specify a local file system
    opt = format.create_load_options()
    opt.file_system = FileSystem.create_local_file_system("textures/")
    # load the file
    scene = Scene.from_file(inputFile, opt)
