## API Changes ##

### Added class **aspose.threed.entities.BooleanOperand**
### Added class **aspose.threed.entities.BooleanOperator**
### Added class **aspose.threed.entities.HalfSpace**

New classes used for creating enhanced Boolean operation as an entity.

### Added members to class **aspose.threed.entities.NurbsCurve**:

{{< highlight python >}}
        @property
        def degree(self) -> int
        @degree.setter
        def degree(self, value : int) -> None
{{< /highlight >}}

This allows you to get or set the degree instead of Order of the NurbsCurve.


### Added members to class **aspose.threed.profiles.ArbitraryProfile**:

{{< highlight python >}}
        @property
        def holes(self) -> List[aspose.threed.entities.Curve]
{{< /highlight >}}


The new property allows you to define holes by closed curves for ArbitraryProfile.
