Linux developers working with Aspose.3D for Python via .NET can benefit from this update's refined animation features, expanded 3MF format compatibility, and comprehensive bug fixes.

### Supercharged Animations

Elevate your Python 3D apps with animations by converting Euler angle-based animations to quaternion-based animations accurately. With the latest Python 3D API release, you can export quaternion-based animations in FBX and glTF formats.

### Introducing 3MF Support for Linux

Python developers can incorporate advanced 3MF file format support functionality using this API version and upgrade their apps running on Linux powered systems.

### glTF File Export

Effortlessly export your glTF files by resampling keyframes during conversion for seamless animation playback and handling incomplete keyframe sequences to prevent exceptions.

### API Enhancements

We have added new properties in the `aspose.threeD.animation.AnimationChannel` class for simplified keyframe sequence management in Aspose.3D for Python via .NET 24.1.0. Additionally, a new `slerp` method simplifies spherical linear interpolation within the `aspose.threeD.utilities.Quaternion` class on Linux systems.

### Bug Fixes

Different fixes have been injected in this release to take care of the problems with NaN rotations, corrupted texture coordinates, file format detection, USDZ/glTF conversion, and USDZ format limitations.
