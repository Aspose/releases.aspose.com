Mac developers using Aspose.3D for Python via .NET 24.1.0 can now take advantage of improved animation workflows, enhanced 3MF support, and critical bug resolutions.

### Animations Boost

Supercharge your 3D document processing apps with animations. Convert Euler angle-based animations to quaternion-based animations accurately with the latest Python 3D API. This feature lets you easily export quaternion-based animations in FBX and glTF formats.

### 3MF Support for Apple Mac

Integrate advanced 3MF file format support using this API version and upgrade your apps running on macOS x64 powered systems.

### glTF Export Enhancements

Export glTF files by resampling keyframes during conversion for smoother animation playback and handling incomplete keyframe sequences to prevent exceptions.

### API Enhancements

We have added new properties in the `aspose.threeD.animation.AnimationChannel` class for simplified keyframe sequence management in Aspose.3D for Python via .NET 24.1.0. Additionally, a new `slerp` method simplifies spherical linear interpolation within the `aspose.threeD.utilities.Quaternion` class on macOS x64 systems.

### Bug Fixes

Several bug fixes have been added in this release to optimize NaN rotations, corrupted texture coordinates, file format detection, USDZ/glTF conversion, and USDZ format limitations.
