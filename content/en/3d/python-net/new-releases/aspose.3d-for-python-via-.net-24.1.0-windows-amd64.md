Aspose.3D for Python via .NET 24.1.0 for Windows 64-bit offers advanced animation capabilities, broader file format support, and essential bug fixes for your development needs.

### Advanced Animations

Python developers can easily convert Euler angle-based animations to quaternion-based animations with the new Python 3D API release. With this feature, you can easily export quaternion-based animations in FBX and glTF formats.

### 3MF Support on Windows x64

Utilize comprehensive 3MF file format support using this API version and upgrade your apps running on Windows 64-bit powered machines.

### Enhanced glTF Export

Resample keyframes during conversion for smoother animation playback and handle incomplete keyframe sequences to prevent exceptions.

### API Enhancements

We have added new properties in the `aspose.threeD.animation.AnimationChannel` class for simplified keyframe sequence management in Aspose.3D for Python via .NET 24.1.0. Additionally, a new `slerp` method simplifies spherical linear interpolation within the `aspose.threeD.utilities.Quaternion` class on Win x64 systems.

### Bug Fixes

Various issues and bugs related to NaN rotations, corrupted texture coordinates, file format detection, USDZ/glTF conversion, and USDZ format limitations have been resolved.
