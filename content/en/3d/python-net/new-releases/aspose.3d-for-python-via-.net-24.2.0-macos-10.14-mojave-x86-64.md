Great news for macOS developers! Aspose.3D for Python via .NET 24.2.0 is released, and it delivers feature enhancements, new public API members, and improves the stability and functionality of the library on macOS x64.

### OBJ to glTF Conversion Upgrades

Seamlessly handle large OBJ files when converting them to the glTF format. This feature of the Python 3D API allows you to convert your OBJ files to glTF format accurately.

### .NET 8.0 Support for Apple Mac

Aspose.3D for Python via .NET 24.2.0 introduces .NET 8.0 framework support and enables Python developers to develop 3D apps for macOS x64 systems by targeting their favorite framework and enhancing compatibility.

### Optimized FBX Export

We have upgraded FBX export in this API release, and it now possesses transformation data for skeleton nodes, which ensures accurate representation.

### TriMesh Functionality Improvements

The newly added `add_triangle()` function in the latest release for macOS x64 machines provides greater control over `TriMesh` objects by allowing manual triangle addition.

### Triangulate the Mesh

Simplify mesh manipulation with the new `triangulate()` function in the `Mesh` class by automatically converting polygons into triangles. The following code example highlights the method usage:

```python

# The plane mesh has only one polygon with 4 control points
mesh = Plane().to_mesh()
# After triangulated, the new mesh's rectangle will become 2 triangles.
triangulated = mesh.triangulate()

```

### Bug Fixes

- GLTF Import Enhancements (THREEDNET-1494): Added support for the KHR_mesh_quantization extension for optimized GLTF imports.
- GLB to FBX Animation Export Fix (THREEDNET-1495): Resolved an issue that caused Slerp failures during animation export from GLB to FBX.
- Maya Importer Stability (THREEDNET-1496): Fixed a bug that could halt the Maya importer when encountering unsupported attribute types.
- USD Import Improvements (THREEDNET-1497): Enhanced handling of USD files with primitives lacking valid property values.
- 3MF Build Element Fix (THREEDNET-1498): Resolved an issue with external references in the build element of 3MF files.
