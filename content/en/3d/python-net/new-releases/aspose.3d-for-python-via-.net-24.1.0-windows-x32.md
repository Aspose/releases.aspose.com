This update to the Aspose.3D for Python via .NET API delivers superior 3D animation and file format handling for your Python applications on Windows 32-bit systems.

### Enhanced Animations

Python developers can now convert Euler angle-based animations to quaternion-based animations and export quaternion-based animations in FBX and glTF formats.

### 3MF Support

Version 24.1.0 of the 3D API enables users to leverage comprehensive support for 3MF format with assembled structures in their 3D document manipulation apps running on Windows 32-bit machines.

### Improved glTF Export

You can resample keyframes during conversion for smoother animation playback with this release, and handle incomplete keyframe sequences to prevent exceptions.

### API Enhancements

We have added new properties in the `aspose.threeD.animation.AnimationChannel` class for simplified keyframe sequence management in the latest API version. Additionally, a new `slerp` method simplifies spherical linear interpolation within the `aspose.threeD.utilities.Quaternion` class.

### Bug Fixes

Aspose.3D for Python via .NET 24.1.0 addresses various issues related to NaN rotations, corrupted texture coordinates, file format detection, USDZ/glTF conversion, and USDZ format limitations.
