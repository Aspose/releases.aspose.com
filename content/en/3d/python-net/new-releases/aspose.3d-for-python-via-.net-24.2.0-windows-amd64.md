We are glad to announce the release of Aspose.3D for Python via .NET 24.2.0! This version includes feature enhancements, new public API members, and improves the stability and functionality of the library on Windows x64 machines.

### Updated OBJ to glTF Conversion

Improved handling of large OBJ files while converting to glTF format is part of this Python 3D API update. It allows you to seamlessly convert your OBJ files to glTF format.

### .NET 8.0 Support on Windows

Aspose.3D for Python via .NET 24.2.0 brings .NET 8.0 framework support, enabling you to develop 3D apps for Windows 64-bit systems by targeting your favorite framework and enhancing compatibility.

### Enhanced FBX Export

FBX export is upgraded in this API release, and it now includes transformation data for skeleton nodes, which ensures accurate representation.

### Improved TriMesh Functionality

We have added the `add_triangle()` function in the latest release of the Python API for Windows 64-bit machines. It provides greater control over `TriMesh` objects by allowing manual triangle addition.

### Mesh Triangulation

Another new addition is the `triangulate()` function in the `Mesh` class, which simplifies mesh manipulation by automatically converting polygons into triangles. The following code example highlights the method usage:

```python

# The plane mesh has only one polygon with 4 control points
mesh = Plane().to_mesh()
# After triangulated, the new mesh's rectangle will become 2 triangles.
triangulated = mesh.triangulate()

```

### Bug Fixes

- GLTF Import Enhancements (THREEDNET-1494): Added support for the KHR_mesh_quantization extension for optimized GLTF imports.
- GLB to FBX Animation Export Fix (THREEDNET-1495): Resolved an issue that caused Slerp failures during animation export from GLB to FBX.
- Maya Importer Stability (THREEDNET-1496): Fixed a bug that could halt the Maya importer when encountering unsupported attribute types.
- USD Import Improvements (THREEDNET-1497): Enhanced handling of USD files with primitives lacking valid property values.
- 3MF Build Element Fix (THREEDNET-1498): Resolved an issue with external references in the build element of 3MF files.
