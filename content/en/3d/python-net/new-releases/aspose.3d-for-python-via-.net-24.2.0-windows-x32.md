We are pleased to announce Aspose.3D for Python via .NET 24.2.0 release! This update delivers feature enhancements, new public API members, and improves the overall stability and functionality of the library on Windows x32 machines.

### Enhanced OBJ to glTF Conversion

Experience improved handling of large OBJ files during conversion to glTF format. With this Python 3D API update, you can seamlessly convert your OBJ files to glTF format.

### .NET 8.0 Support

Aspose.3D for Python via .NET now supports the latest .NET 8.0 framework, allowing you to target the framework of your choice and enhance compatibility of your 3D apps running on Windows 32-bit systems.

### Improved FBX Export

We have upgraded FBX export in this API release, and it now includes transformation data for skeleton nodes, ensuring accurate representation.

### Enhanced TriMesh Functionality

The `add_triangle()` function added in version 24.2.0 of the Python API for Windows 32-bit machines provides greater control over `TriMesh` objects by allowing manual triangle addition.

### New Mesh Triangulation

The newly added `triangulate()` function in the `Mesh` class simplifies mesh manipulation by automatically converting polygons into triangles. The following code example highlights the method usage:

```python

# The plane mesh has only one polygon with 4 control points
mesh = Plane().to_mesh()
# After triangulated, the new mesh's rectangle will become 2 triangles.
triangulated = mesh.triangulate()

```

### Bug Fixes

- GLTF Import Enhancements (THREEDNET-1494): Added support for the KHR_mesh_quantization extension for optimized GLTF imports.
- GLB to FBX Animation Export Fix (THREEDNET-1495): Resolved an issue that caused Slerp failures during animation export from GLB to FBX.
- Maya Importer Stability (THREEDNET-1496): Fixed a bug that could halt the Maya importer when encountering unsupported attribute types.
- USD Import Improvements (THREEDNET-1497): Enhanced handling of USD files with primitives lacking valid property values.
- 3MF Build Element Fix (THREEDNET-1498): Resolved an issue with external references in the build element of 3MF files.
