### Leveled Up Watermark Security

Aspose.3D for Node.js via Java 24.6 prevents users from overriding the existing watermarks that are protected by a password and ascertains the integrity of your 3D assets. 

### Enriched Blender Import

Seamlessly import Blender files with nested textures, skeletons, and deform animations, providing broader compatibility using the latest Node.js 3D file processing library release.

### Improved JT Support

This release also includes enhanced functionalities related to compressed vertex color arrays, TopoMesh LOD data, and improves upon general import issues in JT 9.5 files.

### New Version Information

A new field has now been added to the `com.aspose.threed.Scene` class to retrieve the current Aspose.3D assembly version programmatically.

### Fixed Bugs 

- Resolved issues with importing Blender files containing nested textures (THREEDNET-1547).
- Fixed a bug that prevented importing Blender files with skeletons (THREEDNET-1545).
- Addressed an issue that hindered importing Blender files with deformed animations (THREEDNET-1546).
- Resolved a problem with importing Blender files through `MemoryStream` (THREEDNET-1544).
- Addressed an issue that caused Siemens JT 9.5 TopoMesh's compressed LOD data to fail to load in some files (THREEDNET-1542).
