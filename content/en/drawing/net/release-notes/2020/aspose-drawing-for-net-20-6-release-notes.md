## **Aspose.Drawing for .NET has been launched!**
We are pleased to announce the launch of Aspose.Drawing for .NET. It is a cross-platform library providing System.Drawing and GDI+ compatible API. The drawing engine supports rendering vector graphics (such as lines, curves, and figures) and text (in a variety of fonts, sizes, and styles) onto raster images in all commonly used graphics file formats. The project is based on managed .NET core and does not have dependencies on native code and libraries, with the rendering algorithms working the same way on all supported platforms.
## **Features**
Aspose.Drawing for .NET provides a rich set of features to draw vector graphics primitives (such as lines, curves, and figures) that are specified by sets of points on a coordinate system, to display text in a variety of fonts, sizes, and styles, and to save drawing results in commonly used graphics file formats.
