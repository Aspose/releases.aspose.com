#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Drawing.Common for .NET 24.12 improves performance and accuracy for cross-platform 2D drawing, bitmap manipulation, and image processing.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Clamp Mode Support in Gradient Brushes**  
  Developers can now use `Clamp` mode in `LinearGradientBrush`, allowing for better edge rendering and smooth color transitions in gradient fills.

- **Improved LockBits for Indexed Bitmaps**  
  Bitmap locking operations for 1bpp and 8bpp formats are now significantly faster due to removed format conversion steps.

### üõ† Fix

- **TIFF Frame Selection Hang Fixed**  
  Eliminated application hangs caused by selecting frames in specific multi-page TIFF images.

- **Image Codec Accuracy Improved**  
  Refined the internal logic of image codecs to boost consistency and correctness in rendering.

- **HighQualityBicubic OverflowException Resolved**  
  Fixed an `OverflowException` that occurred when rendering large bitmaps using high-quality interpolation.

- **Container Transformation Issues Fixed**  
  Enhanced transformation handling for grouped elements to maintain accuracy during rendering.
