We're pleased to announce the Aspose.Drawing for .NET 24.5 release (MSI)! This update includes a range of improvements for developers working with images and graphics within their XPS and PostScript (PS) files on the .NET platform.

### Optimized Performance

Supercharge efficiency with optimized `SolidBrush` rendering for specific `PathGradientBrush` configurations in your .NET typesetting solutions. 

### Improved TIFF Handling

We have excluded the loading of reduced TIFF frames in this C# library release. You can now expedite image processing by excluding reduced TIFF frames during the loading process.

### Accurate Text Rendering

Obtain accurate output with Aspose.TeX for .NET 24.5 as we have fixed the issue of drawing invalid surrogate symbols within text.

### Optimized Anti-aliasing

By disabling anti-aliasing when `PathGradientBrush` and `SurroundColors` match `CenterColor`, we have facilitated our users with sharper visuals.
