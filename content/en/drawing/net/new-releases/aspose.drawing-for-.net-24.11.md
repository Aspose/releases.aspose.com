#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Drawing for .NET 24.11 (DLLs + Docs) improves graphics reliability with accurate region intersection handling and added support for broken JPEG image loading.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Region Intersection Logic Fixed**  
  Enhanced geometric accuracy when calculating intersections of graphical regions. This update ensures more precise rendering for complex shapes and clipping operations.

- **Resilient JPEG Loader**  
  Now supports reading JPEG files with minor corruption or partial data, enabling smoother recovery of visual assets and better fault tolerance in image processing pipelines.

### üõ† Fix

- **Region Accuracy Improvements**  
  Fine-tuned region behavior by addressing multiple internal bugs (DRAWINGNET-1554, DRAWINGNET-1555), resulting in better performance for drawing-intensive applications.
