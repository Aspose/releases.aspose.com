We are excited to announce the release of Aspose.Drawing for .NET 24.2 (MSI installer)! This update includes different feature enhancements to simplify your .NET image processing workflows within your drawing apps.

### Unleash Faster Image Processing

Experience significantly improved performance with the latest C# drawing library version. This comes with the implementation of `NearestNeighbor` interpolation while rendering 1-pixel bitmaps.

### Break Region Size Limits

We have empowered the developers to tackle complex image manipulation tasks by working without restrictions as the limitations on region sizes have now been removed.

### Enhanced Region Handling

The issue encountered during `Region.Intersect` operation has been effectively addressed to ensure smoother image processing workflows.
