#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Drawing for .NET 24.12 introduces enhanced graphics rendering and improved bitmap handling for .NET developers across platforms.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Clamp Mode in Linear Gradient Brushes**  
  Added support for `Clamp` mode in `LinearGradientBrush`, enabling developers to control edge rendering in gradients with greater precision.

- **Faster LockBits for Indexed Bitmaps**  
  Locking 1bpp and 8bpp indexed bitmaps now avoids format conversion, improving performance during bitmap manipulations.

### üõ† Fix

- **Improved TIFF Handling**  
  Fixed a hang issue when selecting specific frames in TIFF files.

- **Codec Precision Enhancements**  
  Improved correctness across multiple image file codecs for more predictable rendering outcomes.

- **Interpolation OverflowException Resolved**  
  Addressed `OverflowException` when drawing large bitmaps using `HighQualityBicubic` interpolation mode.

- **Fixed Container Transformations**  
  Resolved inconsistencies when applying transformations to graphical containers.
