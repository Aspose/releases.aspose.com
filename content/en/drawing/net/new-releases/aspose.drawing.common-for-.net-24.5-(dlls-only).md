The Aspose.Drawing.Common for .NET 24.5 (DLLs-only) update delivers a set of core library enhancements designed to elevate your development experience.

### Efficient `SolidBrush` Handling

Benefit from the performance optimization introduced in this release of the .NET library and leverage augmented `SolidBrush` handling within your C# apps.

### Experience Optimized TIFF Processing

Aspose.Drawing.Common for .NET 24.5 lets you gain greater control over TIFF image processing by excluding unwanted reduced frames during loading.

### Render Text Accurately

The latest release of the PS manipulation library includes fixes for the issue that caused invalid surrogate symbols to be drawn incorrectly in text elements.

### Improved Anti-Aliasing

We have disabled anti-aliasing when `PathGradientBrush` and `SurroundColors` match `CenterColor` for sharper visuals.
