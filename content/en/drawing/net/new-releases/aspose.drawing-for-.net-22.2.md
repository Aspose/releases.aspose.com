# Independent StartCap and EndCap in Pen

Implemented independent StartCap and EndCap in Pen which enables you to have more flexibility in cap styles at the beginning and end of drawn lines via API. The following C# code samples how to draw lines of different colors using API:

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-drawing/Aspose.Drawing-for-.NET

using System.Drawing;

Bitmap bitmap = new Bitmap(1000, 800, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppPArgb);
Graphics graphics = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap);

Pen bluePen = new Pen(Color.Blue, 2);
graphics.DrawLine(bluePen, 100, 100, 900, 100);

Pen redPen = new Pen(Color.FromArgb(255, 255, 0, 0), 2);
graphics.DrawLine(redPen, 100, 200, 900, 200);

bitmap.Save("Colors.png");
```
