Aspose.Email for Android via Java 17.4.0 has been released. We have renamed the API from Aspose.Email for Android to Aspose.Email for Java.Android and plan to bring it to the same level of functionality as that of [Aspose.Email for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/email/java/) API. This release doesn't include any API changes other than renaming the API. It means that your applications don't need to incorporate any change in implementation while using this latest release.
