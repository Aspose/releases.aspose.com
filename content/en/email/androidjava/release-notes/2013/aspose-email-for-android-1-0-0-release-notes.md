Aspose.Email for Android 1.0.0 has been launched. It is a message creation, reading and manipulating component for Android developers and users. At its base, Aspose.Email for Android has the strong foundations of its Java ancestor which is already proven for creating, reading and converting email messages to different formats as well as reading, creating and manipulating message storage files, i.e. PST and OST.
## **Supported Email Formats**
Aspose.Email supports all the well-known email formats supported by Outlook:

- Outlook message files (MSG)
- Outlook Template files (OFT)
- EML
- EMLX
- TNEF
- MHT
- PST
- OST
## **Support for Message Storage Files (PST/OST)**
Aspose.Email not only supports manipulating message files, but also gives complete control to manage message storage files, that is Personal Storage Files (PST) and Offline Storage Files (OFT). You can create PST files and add messages to them in no time. With its well-structured API, Aspose.Email gives you complete access to a PST file’s folders, sub-folders and messages for reading and extraction.
## **Supported Operations**
Aspose.Email supports wide range of operations on message storage files (both PST and OST). These are:

- Creating PST file.
- Reading PST file.
- Adding predefined folders to the PST.
- Adding/extracting messages from a PST.
- Adding/saving contacts from a PST.
- Adding/saving calendar items from a PST.
- Adding MapiNotes, journals, notes, tasks, and distribution lists to a PST.
- Deleting items from a PST.
## **Extracting Contacts from a PST/OST**
Aspose.Email gives you access to a PST file’s Contacts folder for managing its contents. You can access the contacts information of each contact using the MapiContact class and can save the item either as Outlook MSG or [VCard](https://docs.aspose.com/email/java/working-with-outlook-contacts/#create-and-save-a-mapicontact) formats.
## **Managing Calendar Items**
Aspose.Email provides full capability for generating calendar items such as appointments and meetings with the option to add recurring information as well as optional fields to the created item. Appointments can be created and saved to disc in draft format or added to a PST’s calendar items. The MapiCalendar class offers all the properties required to completely define a calendar. It also enables you to access and extract MapiCalendar items from PST and save to ICS format.
