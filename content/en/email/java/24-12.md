# What's new in Aspose.Email for Java 24.12

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Email for Java 24.12 introduces the ability to define custom MIME boundary templates for saving MailMessage in EML format, enhancing flexibility for MIME structuring. The release also resolves several issues related to soft-deleted item recovery in OST files and stabilizes deterministic message saving.

## New Features

- **Custom MIME Boundary Templates:**
  - New property `EmlSaveOptions.BoundariesTemplate` lets you customize the format of MIME boundary strings using a template (e.g., `"boundary--{#}"`).
  - Enhances control over EML formatting, especially useful in email processing and testing workflows.

## Enhancements

- **Improved Deterministic Saving of MailMessage:**
  - Ensures that saved messages are consistent across saves, even when multiple sessions or environments are involved.

## Bug Fixes

- **OST Soft-Deleted Item Extraction:**
  - Resolved an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` that occurred with the `FindAndExtractSoftDeletedItems` method in specific OST files.
  - Fixed search compatibility issues with OST 2013 format to ensure accurate item recovery.
