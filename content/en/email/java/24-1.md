# What's new in Aspose.Email for Java 24.1

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Email for Java 24.1 introduces a more compatible HTML resource folder naming scheme and resolves several critical bugs related to email encoding, attachment parsing, MHTML conversion, and memory handling for large emails.

## Enhancements

- **Improved Resource Folder Naming for HTML Output:**
  - When saving an email to HTML with resources, the folder will now follow the `target_files` convention instead of `target.files`, enhancing compatibility across file systems and platforms.
  - This applies to scenarios using `HtmlSaveOptions.setResourceRenderingMode(SaveToFile)` with `setUseRelativePathToResources(true)`.

## Bug Fixes

- **UTF-7 Encoding Issue Resolved:**
  - Corrected reading logic for UTF-7 encoded email content, ensuring accurate character representation.

- **Relative Recurrence Rule Fix:**
  - Fixed parsing errors for relative recurrence rules in `.ics` files during calendar processing.

- **Attachment Metadata Restoration:**
  - Resolved issue where attachment names and extensions were missing or incorrectly parsed from certain email formats.

- **MHTML Conversion Accuracy:**
  - Improved fidelity when converting specific `.msg` files to MHTML, fixing layout and formatting mismatches.

- **Java Heap Space Optimization:**
  - Fixed memory overflow (`Java Heap Space`) when processing very large email messages or attachments.
