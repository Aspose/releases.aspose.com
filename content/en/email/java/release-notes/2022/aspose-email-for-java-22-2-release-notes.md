## **New Features**



### **Support for the reference attachments**

A reference attachment is an alternative to the local file attachment. In some cases, reference attachments may be preferable, for example, if you want to manage its access.

#### **Changes in public API**

`ReferenceAttachment` - represents a reference attachment.
`AttachmentPermissionType` - The permission type data associated with a web reference attachment.
`AttachmentProviderType` - The type of web service manipulating the attachment.

#### **Code sample**

```java
MailMessage eml = MailMessage.load("fileName");

ReferenceAttachment refAttach = new ReferenceAttachment("https://[attach_uri]")
refAttach.setName("Document.docx");
refAttach.setProviderType(AttachmentProviderType.OneDrivePro);
refAttach.setPermissionType(AttachmentPermissionType.AnyoneCanEdit);

eml.getAttachments().addItem(refAttach);
```



### **Retrieving message class from ExchangeMessageInfo object**

We have added `MessageClass` property to `ExchangeMessageInfo` class.

#### **Code sample**

```java
try (IEWSClient client = EWSClient.getEWSClient(uri, credentials))
{
    ExchangeMessageInfoCollection messageInfoCollection = client.listMessagesFromPublicFolder(publicFolder);

    for (ExchangeMessageInfo messageInfo : messageInfoCollection)
    {
        System.out.println("Message Class: " + messageInfo.getMessageClass());
    }
}
```
