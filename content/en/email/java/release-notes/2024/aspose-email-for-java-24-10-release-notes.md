## **New Features**

### Retrieve Reaction Information from MSG

We've introduced the ability to access user reactions from MSG. The new `getReactions` method, added to the `FollowUpManager` class, allows you to retrieve a list of reactions on a MAPI message, making it easy to analyze user engagement.

**New Method:**

- `FollowUpManager.getReactions(MapiMessageItemBase message)`  
  Retrieves available reactions for a specified message, providing insight into user interactions.

**Usage Example:**

```java
// Load the message file
MapiMessage msg = MapiMessage.load(fileName);

// Retrieve the list of reactions on the message
Iterable<UserReaction> reactions = FollowUpManager.getReactions(msg);

// Iterate through each reaction and output the details to the console
for (UserReaction reaction : reactions) {
    System.out.println("User: " + reaction.getName() + "), Email: " + reaction.getEmail()
            + ", Reaction: " + reaction.getType() + ", Date: " + reaction.getReactionDateTime());
}
```

The feature provides a way to gather and analyze reactions on messages.
