## New Enhancements

### Support for Exchange X.500 Address in MailAddress

Aspose.Email MailAddress now supports retrieving the Exchange X.500 address from messages. A new field X500Address has been added to the MailAddress object, which stores the X.500 address if available in the message headers. This allows for improved compatibility with Exchange-based systems and better handling of internal recipient addresses.

**New Option:**

* `MailAddress.X500Address`
  Gets the email address in Exchange format, if it exists.

**Usage Example:**

```java
MailMessage mailMessage = MailMessage.load(fileName);
System.out.println("Exchange Address: " + mailMessage.getFrom().getX500Address());
System.out.println("Exchange Address: " + mailMessage.getSender().getX500Address());
```
