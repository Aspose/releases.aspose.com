# What's new in Aspose.Email for Java 24.5

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Email for Java 24.5 introduces key enhancements for PST and VCF file management. New features include recipient extraction by entry ID from PST, recovery of soft-deleted items, and converting multi-contact VCFs to `MapiDistributionList` objects. The update also improves message date accuracy from MBOX and resolves various calendar and attachment issues.

## New Features

- **PST Recipient Extraction by Entry ID:**
  - Added the ability to extract `MapiRecipientCollection` directly using a message's entry ID or `MessageInfo` from a PST file. This allows precise recipient retrieval without fully loading the message.

- **Soft Deleted Item Recovery in PST/OST Files:**
  - New support for identifying and restoring soft-deleted messages from local PST or OST storage. Recovered items can be saved externally for auditing or migration purposes.

- **Multi-Contact VCF to MapiDistributionList Conversion:**
  - Allows bulk VCF contact files to be imported and converted into `MapiDistributionList`, streamlining contact group creation from vCard files.

## Enhancements

- **Corrected Sent Date from MBOX:**
  - The issue of incorrect sent date values being stored when converting MBOX emails to MSG format has been resolved, improving metadata consistency.

## Bug Fixes

- **Attachment Replacement Fix:**
  - Fixed `InvalidCastException` error triggered when attempting to replace the content stream of an email attachment.

- **ICS File Event Reading Issue:**
  - Resolved a bug that prevented reading events from `.ics` calendar files.

- **Calendar Item Creation Bug:**
  - Fixed an error where a calendar item could not be created inside a non-calendar folder, ensuring smoother folder-specific operations.
