# What's new in the Aspose.Email for Java 25.4

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Email for Java 25.4 focuses on usability improvements in VCard loading and HTML message rendering, along with critical bug fixes related to PST handling, calendar accuracy, and pagination functionality.

## Enhancements

- **Improved VCard Handling with VCardLoadOptions:**
  Introduced overloads of `MapiContact.fromVCard` that now accept `VCardLoadOptions` instead of `Charset`. This provides enhanced flexibility when loading contacts from VCF files and aligns with modern character encoding standards.

- **Stream Support for Saving HTML with Embedded Icons:**
  Enhanced the API to allow saving messages to HTML using streams instead of file paths, enabling better preservation of embedded attachment icons across platforms.

## Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Mbox Reader Initialization Error:**
  Resolved `System.InvalidOperationException` thrown during MboxStorageReader creation, improving stability when processing mailbox files.

- **Corrected PST Email Search by Sender (From):**
  Fixed an issue where querying messages by sender address in PST returned `null`. Search queries now return the correct results.

- **Resolved Appointment Loading Exception:**
  Addressed error `Unknown type of ActionProperty` when loading certain appointments, ensuring more reliable calendar parsing.

- **PST File Handling Stability:**
  - Fixed `NegativeArraySizeException` when adding files to PST.
  - Corrected issues encountered when marking messages as read/unread within PST files.

- **Accurate VCALENDAR Priority Data:**
  Fixed a data mapping issue that caused incorrect values in the PRIORITY field of VCALENDAR entries.

- **Pagination in FolderInfo.getContents():**
  Resolved pagination inaccuracies when using the `getContents(MailQuery, int, int)` method to retrieve messages in PST folders.

## Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes

### Added

- **`MapiContact.fromVCard(String path, VCardLoadOptions options)`**
  - Overload to load VCard files using advanced options.
- **`VCardLoadOptions` class**
  - Used to configure how VCard data is interpreted.

### Deprecated

- **`MapiContact.fromVCard(String path, Charset charset)`**
  - Marked for future removal. Users should switch to using `VCardLoadOptions`.
