# What's new in Aspose.Email for Java 24.6

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Email for Java 24.6 enhances control over long-running Mbox operations by introducing the ability to cancel `splitInto()` tasks mid-process. This release also improves stability and efficiency in email conversions and communication operations, addressing key issues in VCF handling, PGP decryption, and IMAP/SMTP memory usage.

## New Features

- **Cancelable Mbox Splitting Operation:**
  - Introduced a `cancel()` method in `MboxrdStorageReader` allowing developers to abort ongoing `splitInto()` operations. This is especially useful for managing large MBOX files or resource-intensive processes in multithreaded environments.

## Enhancements

- **Improved Operation Management:**
  - Long-running MBOX operations can now be terminated early, giving developers better memory and process control.

## Bug Fixes

- **VCF Load Issue Resolved:**
  - Fixed a bug that prevented VCF files from being loaded successfully in certain scenarios.

- **Soft-Deleted Item Recovery Issue Fixed:**
  - Resolved a bug in `findAndExtractSoftDeletedItems` that caused incorrect extraction results from PST/OST files.

- **PGP Encrypted MSG to MIME Conversion Fix:**
  - Ensured consistent and non-corrupted conversion of PGP-encrypted MSG emails to MIME format.

- **Reduced Memory Usage in SMTP/IMAP Clients:**
  - Optimized memory footprint when sending and receiving emails using `SmtpClient` and `ImapClient`.

- **MSG 'From' Field in MIME Conversion Corrected:**
  - Corrected formatting of the “From” address during MSG to MIME conversion to align with standard output.

- **VCF to Distribution List Conversion Bug Resolved:**
  - Corrected issues with contact data loss when converting VCF files to distribution lists.
