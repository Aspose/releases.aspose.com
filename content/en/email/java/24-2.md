# What's new in Aspose.Email for Java 24.2

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Email for Java 24.2 introduces the ability to extract category colors from Outlook OLM files and enforce strict container class validation when creating folders in PST files. Several critical issues with ICS import, message encoding, and TNEF conversion are also resolved.

## New Features

- **Retrieve Category Colors from OLM Files:**
  - New `OlmItemCategory` class captures Outlook item categories with color in hexadecimal format (e.g., `#FF0000`).
  - `OlmStorage.getCategories()` provides access to category names and their colors for OLM messages.
  - Useful for email classification, tagging, and visual mapping.

- **Strict Container Class Validation for PST Folders:**
  - New `FolderCreationOptions.setEnforceContainerClassMatching(true)` ensures structural consistency by checking compatibility between parent and child folders in PST.
  - Prevents structural errors by validating container classes like `IPF.Note`, `IPF.Contact`.

## Enhancements

- **Improved Folder Creation Logic in PST:**
  - Enhanced logic to investigate and handle mismatched folder container types more gracefully.

## Bug Fixes

- **ICS Format Compatibility:**
  - Fixed invalid ICS export that previously failed to import into Gmail and Google Calendar.

- **TNEF Email Conversion:**
  - Resolved PST conversion failure when handling complex TNEF-based emails.

- **Email Encoding Detection:**
  - Enhanced encoding detection and parsing, particularly for `.msg` files with non-UTF encodings.

- **Empty Body Issue:**
  - Resolved cases where `MapiMessage.getBody()` returned null unexpectedly.
