# What's new in the Aspose.Email for Java 25.3

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Email for Java 25.3 introduces support for TNEF attachments in Outlook messages, enriched control over calendar states, and enhanced MAPI folder querying capabilities. This version also includes significant bug fixes and improvements for better handling of email formats such as MSG and EML.

## New Features

- **Support for TNEF Attachment Operations:**
  You can now load and save attachments in TNEF format (`winmail.dat`) via `MapiAttachment.loadFromTnef()` and `saveToTnef()` methods, enabling deeper Outlook message compatibility.

- **Force Set State for Calendar Objects:**
  A new method `setStateForced()` in `MapiCalendar` allows explicit control over calendar event states, including setting a calendar object to ‘Received’ for better calendar handling and saving scenarios.

- **Filtered and Paginated Message Retrieval from PST:**
  The `FolderInfo.getContents()` method now supports applying a `MailQuery` with pagination (start index, count), streamlining large mailbox processing.

## Enhancements

- **Improved Time Zone and Organizer Visibility for MSG Calendar Events:**
  Refinements in how calendar data is processed and saved ensure accurate time zone offsets and organizer display.

- **Support for Search Queries in PST Folder Pagination:**
  Enhanced message filtering within PST folders now includes full support for indexed searching using `MailQuery`.

## Bug Fixes

- **EML to HTML: Space Loss Resolved:**
  Fixed an issue where spaces were omitted in the output HTML when converting from EML.

- **Inline Image Detection:**
  Corrected the `IsInline` property behavior in `MapiAttachment`, which now accurately reflects whether an attachment is inline.

- **Appointment Loading Errors:**
  Fixed `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` and `ArgumentNullException` that occurred under specific calendar loading scenarios.

- **Meeting Response Misclassification:**
  Resolved an issue where meeting response messages were incorrectly saved as requests instead of replies.

- **Attachment Filename Missing in MSG to EML Conversion:**
  Resolved formatting inconsistency in the `Content-Disposition` header.

- **FormatException in EML to MSG Conversion:**
  Handled edge cases where certain EML content led to format exceptions during conversion.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

### New Classes and Methods:

- `MapiAttachment.loadFromTnef(String/Stream)`
- `MapiAttachment.saveToTnef(String/Stream)`
- `MapiCalendar.setStateForced(MapiCalendarState)`
