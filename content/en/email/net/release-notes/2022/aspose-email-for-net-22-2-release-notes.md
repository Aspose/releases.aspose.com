## **New Features**



### **Support for the reference attachments**

A reference attachment is an alternative to the local file attachment. In some cases, reference attachments may be preferable, for example, if you want to manage its access.

#### **Changes in public API**

`Aspose.Email.ReferenceAttachment` - represents a reference attachment.
`Aspose.Email.AttachmentPermissionType` - The permission type data associated with a web reference attachment.
`Aspose.Email.AttachmentProviderType` - The type of web service manipulating the attachment.

#### **Code sample**

```cs
var eml = MailMessage.Load("fileName");

var refAttach = new ReferenceAttachment("https://[attach_uri]")
{
    Name = "Document.docx",
    ProviderType = AttachmentProviderType.OneDrivePro,
    PermissionType = AttachmentPermissionType.AnyoneCanEdit
};

eml.Attachments.Add(refAttach);
```



### **Retrieving message class from ExchangeMessageInfo object**

We have added `MessageClass` property to `ExchangeMessageInfo` class.

#### **Code sample**

```cs
using (var client = EWSClient.GetEWSClient(uri, credentials))
{
    var messageInfoCollection = client.ListMessagesFromPublicFolder(publicFolder);

    foreach (var messageInfo in messageInfoCollection)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Message Class: {0}", messageInfo.MessageClass);
    }
}
```
