## **New Features**



### **Working with MailGun and SendGrid delivery services**

We've added the ability to send messages using [MailGun](https://www.mailgun.com/) or [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) services. 
We have created a unified API, so the first thing is to initialize options depending on which service is going to be used for sending messages.

**MailGun client** options.

```csharp
string domain = "YOUR_MAILGUN_DOMEN";
string privApiKey = "YOUR_MAILGUN_PRIVATE_API_KEY";
var opt = new MailgunClientOptions { Domain = domain, ApiKey = privApiKey };
```

**SendGrid client** options.

```csharp
string privApiKey = "YOUR_SENDGRID_PRIVATE_API_KEY";
var opt = new SendGridClientOptions { ApiKey = privApiKey };
```

Then, call the required client instance using the builder.

```csharp
IDeliveryServiceClient client = DeliveryServiceClientFactory.Get(opt);
```

Finally, prepare and send an email message.

```csharp
MailMessage eml = new MailMessage(fromAddress, toAddress, subject, body);

var resp = client.Send(eml);

if (!resp.Successful)
{
    foreach (var error in resp.ErrorMessages)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(error);
    }
}
```

There is also an asynchronous version of the Send method.

```csharp
MailMessage eml = new MailMessage(fromAddress, toAddress, subject, body);

var sendTask = client.SendAsync(eml);
sendTask.Wait();

if (!sendTask.Result.Successful)
{
    foreach (var error in sendTask.Result.ErrorMessages)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(error);
    }
}
```



### **Changes in the setting of the X-ALT-DESC header in ICS file**

We introduced a separate HtmlDescription property instead of the IsDescriptionHtml property to set the X-ALT-DESC header.

```csharp
var appointment = new Appointment("Bygget 83",
    DateTime.UtcNow, // start date
    DateTime.UtcNow.AddHours(1), // end date
    new MailAddress("TintinStrom@from.com", "Tintin Strom"), // organizer
    new MailAddress("AinaMartensson@to.com", "Aina Martensson")) // attendee
{
    HtmlDescription = @"
    <html>
     <style type=""text/css"">
      .text {
             font-family:'Comic Sans MS';
             font-size:16px;
            }
     </style>
    <body>
     <p class=""text"">Hi, I'm happy to invite you to our party.</p>
    </body>
    </html>"
};
```
