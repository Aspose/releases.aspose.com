## **New Enhancements**


### **Obtaining the identification info for messages received from a mailbox**

Sometimes, when processing messages received from the server, it is required to get the message identification info such as UID or sequence number.

**Changes in public API:**

 - `Aspose.Email.MailboxInfo` class - Represents identification information about message in a mailbox.
    - `Aspose.Email.MailboxInfo.SequenceNumber` property - The sequence number of message.
    - `Aspose.Email.MailboxInfo.UniqueId` property - The unique id of message.
 - `Aspose.Email.MailMessage.ItemId` property - Represents identification information about message in a mailbox.

**Code samples:**

```csharp
using (var client = new ImapClient(imapHost, port, emailAddress, password, securityOption))
{
    var msgs = client.ListMessages("INBOX").Take(5);
    var seqIds = msgs.Select(t => t.SequenceNumber);
    var msgsViaFetch = client.FetchMessages(seqIds);
	
    for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        var thisMsg = msgsViaFetch[i];
        Console.WriteLine($"Message ID:{seqIds.ElementAt(i)} SequenceNumber: {thisMsg.ItemId.SequenceNumber} Subject:{thisMsg.Subject}");
    }
}
```
