## New Features

### Ability to Add Attachments to Messages in PST

The `PersonalStorage` class has been enhanced with new methods that allow adding attachments directly to messages stored within a PST file. This functionality provides greater flexibility for modifying existing messages by programmatically attaching files or streams.

The following methods have been introduced:

* `AddAttachmentToMessage(MessageInfo messageInfo, string name, Stream stream)`
  Adds an attachment to the specified message using the provided stream as the attachment content.

* `AddAttachmentToMessage(MessageInfo messageInfo, string filePath)`
  Adds an attachment to the specified message using the file located at the given path.

* `AddAttachmentToMessage(string entryId, string name, Stream stream)`
  Adds an attachment to the message identified by the specified entry ID using the provided stream.

* `AddAttachmentToMessage(string entryId, string filePath)`
  Adds an attachment to the message identified by the specified entry ID using the file located at the given path.

Here’s a simple example demonstrating how to add an attachment to a message in a PST file using the `AddAttachmentToMessage` method:

```csharp

// Load the PST file
using (PersonalStorage pst = PersonalStorage.FromFile("Outlook.pst"))
{
    // Get the Inbox folder
    FolderInfo inbox = pst.RootFolder.GetSubFolder("Inbox");

    // Retrieve information about the first message
    MessageInfo messageInfo = inbox.GetContents().First();

    // Specify the file to attach
    string attachmentPath = "C:\\Documents\\Report.pdf";

    // Add the attachment to the message
    pst.AddAttachmentToMessage(messageInfo, attachmentPath);
}
```

This example loads an existing PST file, accesses the Inbox folder, retrieves the first message, and adds a file (`Report.pdf`) as an attachment to that message.
The operation modifies the message directly inside the PST without the need to extract or rebuild it.
