## **Major Changes**
### **Support for .NET Standard 2.0**
Starting from 17.12 release, the API now includes .NET Standard 2.0 version. It has full functionality of standard .NET Framework except the following limitations:

- Aspose.Email.Clients.ActiveSync.TransportLayer namespace is not available
- Aspose.Email.Windows namespace is not available
- Aspose.Email.Printing namespace is not available
- Linked images into message body in both RTF as well as HTML format are not supported
- It also has no functionality of Signing or Encrypting/Decrypting messages
- Aspose.Email under .NET Core will work only with servers that implement at least TLS 1.0. Some servers (like Gmail) support both SSL and TLS. Aspose.Email can force them to use TLS.
### **Merged Xamarin APIs**
Staring from this release, Aspose.Email for Android via Xamarin, Aspose.Email for iOS via Xamarin and Aspose.Email for Mac via Xamarin have become part of Aspose.Email for .NET. There are no breaking changes.
