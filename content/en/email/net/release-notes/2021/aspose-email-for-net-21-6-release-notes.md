## **New Enhancements**

### **Using a return-client-request-id HTTP header in the EWSClient**

The `return-client-request-id` header is sent in the request and used by the server to determine whether the `client-request-id` header specified by the client should be returned in the server response.

We have added the `ReturnClientRequestId` property to `EWSClient`:

```csharp
// Gets or sets a value to indicate whether 
// the client requires the server-side to return the request-id.
public bool ReturnClientRequestId
```

**Code sample:**

```csharp
using (IEWSClient client = TestUtil.CreateEWSClient(user))
{
    // Client will create random id and pass it to the server.
	// The server should include this id in request-id header of all responses.
    client.ReturnClientRequestId = true;
    
	client.LogFileName = "ews.log";
    client.GetMailboxInfo();
}
```

### **Setting the cryptographic protocol without compatibility checks**

We have added an `EmailClient.SetSupportedEncryptionUnsafe(EncryptionProtocols value)` method. This method sets a certain cryptographic protocol without any compatibility checks.

**For example:**

TLS 1.2 is generally not supported by .NET Framework 3.5. 

But when you call

```csharp
SetSupportedEncryptionUnsafe(EncryptionProtocols.Tls12);
```

TLS 1.2 will be used with .NET Framework 3.5.
