## **New Enhancements**

### **Obtaining preamble and epilogue from eml messages**

The MIME format allows text (i.e. preamble) between the blank line following the headers, and the first multipart boundary and text (i.e. epilogue) between the last boundary and the end of the message. Normally this text is never visible in mail readers. 
However, some MIME implementations use this space to insert a note for recipients who read the message using non-MIME-compliant programs.

We have added appropriate properties to the MailMessage:

```csharp
// Gets or sets a preamble text.
public string Preamble

// Gets or sets an epilogue text.
public string Epilogue
```

### **Support for multiple contacts in VCard format**

We have added support for reading multiple contacts in VCard format.

**Changes in public API:**

```csharp
// Checks whether VCard source stream contains multiple contacts.
VCardContact.IsMultiContacts(Stream stream)

// Loads list of all contacts from VCard file.
VCardContact.LoadAsMultiple(string filePath, Encoding encoding)

// Loads list of all contacts from VCard stream.
VCardContact.LoadAsMultiple(Stream stream, Encoding encoding)
```
**Code sample:**

```csharp
using (FileStream stream = new FileStream("test.vcf", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read))
{
    if(VCardContact.IsMultiContacts(stream))
    {
        List<VCardContact> contacts = VCardContact.LoadAsMultiple(stream, Encoding.UTF8);
    }
}
```
