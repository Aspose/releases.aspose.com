## **New Features**

### **Saving appointments to MSG format**

It's now possible to save appointments directly to **.msg** files.
The following public classes have been added to the API:

- `AppointmentMsgSaveOptions` 

  class with additional options to save appointments in msg format.

- `AppointmentIcsSaveOptions` 

  class with additional options to save appointment in ics format. **It was added to replace the obsolete IcsSaveOptions.**

#### **Code example**

```csharp
var appointment = Appointment.Load(fileName);
appointment.Save(fileName + ".ics", new AppointmentIcsSaveOptions());
appointment.Save(fileName + ".msg", new AppointmentMsgSaveOptions(););
```
### **Preserving RTF body when converting MapiMessage to MailMesage**

#### **Changes in public API**

- `MsgLoadOptions.PreserveRtfContent` 

  Gets or sets a value indicating whether to keep the rtf body in MailMessage.

- `MailConversionOptions.PreserveRtfContent` 

  Gets or sets a value indicating whether to keep the rtf body in MailMessage.

#### **Code example**

```csharp
var appointment = Appointment.Load(fileName);
appointment.Save(fileName + ".ics", new AppointmentIcsSaveOptions());
appointment.Save(fileName + ".msg", new AppointmentMsgSaveOptions(););
```

### **Displaying the optional attendees in the mht header output**

#### **Changes in public API**

- `MhtTemplateName.OptionalAttendees` 

  Optional attendees header name.

#### Code example

```csharp
MhtSaveOptions options = new MhtSaveOptions()
{
    MhtFormatOptions = MhtFormatOptions.RenderCalendarEvent | MhtFormatOptions.WriteHeader
};

MapiMessage msg = MapiMessage.Load(fileName);
msg.Save(fileName + ".mhtml", options);

//if you need to skip OptionalAttendees in mhtml file you can clear format template for OptionalAttendees
options.FormatTemplates[MhtTemplateName.OptionalAttendees] = "";
msg.Save(fileName + "2.mhtml", options);
```
