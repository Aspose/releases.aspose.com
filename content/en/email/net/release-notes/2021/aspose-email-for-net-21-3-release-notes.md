## **New Enhancements**

### **Getting information about bulk messages sent**
When you send messages in bulk, you can get an information about the number of successfully sent messages and moreover, it is possible to get a list of these messages. 
A new **SucceededSending** event was added to **SmtpClient** for this purpose.

Code sample:
```cs
using (SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient(host, SecurityOptions.Auto))
{
    int messageCount = 0;

    client.SucceededSending += (sender, eventArgs) =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The message '{0}' was successfully sent.", eventArgs.Message.Subject);
        messageCount++;
    };

    client.Send(messages);

    Console.WriteLine("{0} messages were successfully sent.", messageCount);
}
```
### **LinkedResource.ContentDisposition property**

A **LinkedResource.ContentDisposition** property has been added to get Content-Disposition header.

Code sample:

```cs
MailMessage eml = MailMessage.Load(fileName);
eml.LinkedResources[0].ContentDisposition.FileName = "changed.png";
```
