## **New Enhancements**

### **Fixed Resource Folder Naming Scheme for Email Message HTML Saving**

In response to user feedback we have updated the resource folder naming convention. When saving email messages into HTML files with associated resources (e.g. images), the Aspose.Email will now utilize the [html file name]_files scheme instead of the [html file name].files convention. 
This revised naming scheme ensures better compatibility.

#### **Code sample**

```csharp
var msg = MapiMessage.Load(sourceFileName);

var htmlSaveOptions = new HtmlSaveOptions
{
    ResourceRenderingMode = ResourceRenderingMode.SaveToFile,
    UseRelativePathToResources = true
};

msg.Save(Path.Combine("target.html"), htmlSaveOptions);
```
If the HTML file is named "target.html," the associated resource default folder will be named "target_files."
