## **New Features**

### Retrieve Reaction Information from MSG

We've introduced the ability to access user reactions from MSG. The new `GetReactions` method, added to the `FollowUpManager` class, allows you to retrieve a list of reactions on a MAPI message, making it easy to analyze user engagement.

**New Method:**

- `FollowUpManager.GetReactions(MapiMessageItemBase message)`  
  Retrieves available reactions for a specified message, providing insight into user interactions.

**Usage Example:**

```csharp
// Load the message file
var msg = MapiMessage.Load(fileName);

// Retrieve the list of reactions on the message
var reactions = FollowUpManager.GetReactions(msg);

// Iterate through each reaction and output the details to the console
foreach (var reaction in reactions)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"User: {reaction.Name}, Email: {reaction.Email}, Reaction: {reaction.Type}, Date: {reaction.ReactionDateTime}");
}
```

The feature provides a way to gather and analyze reactions on messages.
