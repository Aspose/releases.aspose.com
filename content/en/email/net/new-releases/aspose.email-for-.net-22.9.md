# Support for OLM Email Format

Support has been added for the `OLM` extension which is a Microsoft Outlook&reg; format for macOS&reg;. These are somewhat similar to the `PST` extension of Outlook&reg; for Windows&reg;. `OLM` are binary files with `Application/octet-stream` `MIME` type.

# List & Order Messages in Microsoft Graph

Added the OrderBy feature for listing the email messages in the Microsoft Graph&reg; Client.

```csharp
IGraphClient client = GraphClient.GetClient(provider, TenantId);

var builder = new GraphQueryBuilder();

// create orderby messages query 'DESC'
builder.SentDate.OrderBy(false);
var messagePageInfo = client.ListMessages(KnownFolders.Inbox, new PageInfo(10), builder.GetQuery());
var messages = messagePageInfo.Items;

builder.Clear();

// create orderby messages query 'ASC'
builder.SentDate.OrderBy(true);
messagePageInfo = client.ListMessages(KnownFolders.Inbox, new PageInfo(10), builder.GetQuery());
messages = messagePageInfo.Items;
```

# Send Email containing Images with SendGrid

In some previously instances, the images were broken after sending email with SendGrid. This issue has now been resolved.

# EML to MSG Conversion with Chinese Text

Previously there was an EML to MSG conversion issue in case of the Chinese text. This issue has now been resolved.
