# Better Handling of Sending Email via SMTP

While working with the version 21.12 of the API, the `Operation has been canceled` issue occurred in some instances when sending email through SMTP. This issue has now been resolved.

# Improved IMAP Seen Flag Handling

Previously, Aspose IMAP Seen flag was always being returned as `false`. This issue has now been fixed.

# Improvements in MBOX Inbox Management

In some instances the mail messages were being removed after we added a new message to the existing MBOX. This issue has now been resolved.
