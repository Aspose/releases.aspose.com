#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Email for .NET 25.3 (DLLs Only) introduces granular TNEF attachment operations and lets you set calendar states manually. It also fixes issues related to appointments, inline images, and email format consistency.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **TNEF Attachment API**: Add and extract attachments from winmail.dat via new MapiAttachment methods.
- **Forced Calendar State**: Control message class and organizer metadata via `SetStateForced`.

### üîß Enhancement

- Improved reliability for MSG appointment state handling with time zone accuracy.

### üõ† Fix

- Fixed `IsInline` misbehavior for inline image detection in MapiAttachment.
- Resolved conversion bugs: EML ‚ûù HTML, MSG ‚ûù calendar, and incorrect meeting request handling.
- Addressed crashes in IMAP login and appointment loading scenarios.

### üîç Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Methods**:
  - `MapiAttachment.LoadFromTnef()` / `SaveToTnef()` for TNEF format integration.
  - `MapiCalendar.SetStateForced()` for explicit calendar control.
