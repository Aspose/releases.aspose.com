### Enhanced Mbox Splitting

Aspose.Email for .NET 24.4 delivers improved `MboxStorageReader.SplitInto` method for better efficiency in your C# email processing apps.

### Signature Attachment

Developers can now attach signatures while saving email messages and upgrade their .NET email manipulation workflows.

### Version Control for Contact Files

Effortlessly control the version of the contacts files when saving with `MapiDistributionListSaveOptions` with this update to the C# email API.

### Bug Fixes
We have resolved issues with ICS to `MapiMessage` conversion, attachment visibility in HTML, EWS Client Contacts API updates, EML file loading, and date calculations for recurring `MapiTasks`.
