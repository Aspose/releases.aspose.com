# Email Extraction from PST

Previously, in some instances the messages extracted from PST file were not being opened in the Outlook&reg; 2016. This issue has now been resolved.

# Set Header in iCalendar `ICS` File

Added the feature to set the `X-ALT-DESC` header within an ICS file. The X-ALT-DESC header is a HTML formatted description in iCalendar (.ics) items.

For creating an appointment with HTML content, set the `IsDescriptionHtml` property to true.

```csharp
var appointment = new Appointment("Bygget 83",
    DateTime.UtcNow, // start date
    DateTime.UtcNow.AddHours(1), // end date
    new MailAddress("TintinStrom@from.com", "Tintin Strom"), // organizer
    new MailAddress("AinaMartensson@to.com", "Aina Martensson")) // attendee
{
    IsDescriptionHtml = true,

    Description = @"
      <html>
       <style type=""text/css"">
        .text {
               font-family:'Comic Sans MS';
               font-size:16px;
              }
       </style>
      <body>
       <p class=""text"">Hi, I'm happy to invite you to our party.</p>
      </body>
      </html>"
};
```

# Faster Performance While Reading Attachments

In some instances, it as observed that the performance of the API deteriorated while reading attachment detail with size 5MB using IMAP API. This issue has now been resolved.

```csharp
var messageInfoCollection = imapClient.ListMessages();
    
foreach (var message in messageInfoCollection)
{
    var attachmentInfoCollection = imapClient.ListAttachments(message.SequenceNumber);

    foreach (var attachmentInfo in attachmentInfoCollection)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Attachment: {0} (size: {1})", attachmentInfo.Name, attachmentInfo.Size);
    }
}
```
