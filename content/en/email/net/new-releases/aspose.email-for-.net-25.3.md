#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Email for .NET 25.3 introduces full TNEF (winmail.dat) attachment support and the ability to force calendar item states. This release also patches critical bugs in EML conversion, calendar handling, and IMAP authentication.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **TNEF Attachment Handling**: Load and save TNEF files directly using MapiAttachment extensions.
- **Calendar State Override**: Use `SetStateForced` to define `MapiCalendar` states explicitly.

### üîß Enhancement

- Improved calendar state accuracy for MSG format with enhanced time zone offset interpretation.

### üõ† Fix

- Corrected space loss during EML to HTML conversion.
- Resolved `MapiAttachment.IsInline` always returning false for inline images.
- Fixed `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` and `ArgumentNullException` when loading appointments.
- Addressed incorrect method type used for meeting responses.
- Prevented IMAP client crashes on invalid login credentials.

### üîç Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Methods**:
  - `MapiAttachment.LoadFromTnef(string|Stream)` and `SaveToTnef(string|Stream)`
  - `MapiCalendar.SetStateForced(MapiCalendarState)`
- **Updated Behaviors**:
  - Forced control of calendar message class and state for accurate message preservation.
