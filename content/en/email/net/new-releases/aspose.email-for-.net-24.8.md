Boost functionality and resolve several issues encountered in previous versions using the latest Aspose.Email for .NET 24.8 (MSI) release. This release is essential for developers who seek robust and reliable email management APIs in C# and VB.NET email applications. 

### Refined SMIME Content-Type

The latest .NET email processing API version introduces the `smime-type` attribute to the SMIME Content-Type and empowers email security features.

### Improved ICS Format Compatibility

We have resolved the issue where the `EndDate` of `Recurrence` was empty when saving `MapiCalendar` to ICS format.

### Bug Fixes
- Resolved an exception triggered by `ImapClient.FetchMessage` due to incorrect message length parameters.
- Fixed issues in the `Mboxrd Writer` to ensure consistent message export.
- Corrected the malfunctioning `FindAndExtractSoftDeletedItems` method.
- Addressed the error during the .NET 7 to .NET 8 migration.
- Fixed an exception occurring while reading Zimbra (.tgz) files.
