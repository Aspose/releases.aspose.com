#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Email for .NET 24.10 introduces support for retrieving reactions from MSG messages and improves PST recipient field search. This release also addresses key regressions in MSG, EML, and HTML conversion logic.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **MSG Reactions Support**: Retrieve user reaction details including emoji type, user info, and timestamps via `FollowUpManager.GetReactions()`.

### üîß Enhancement

- Improved recipient matching logic across **To**, **Cc**, and **Bcc** fields in PST searches.

### üõ† Fix

- Fixed duplicate soft-deleted items returned in `FindAndExtractSoftDeletedItems`.
- Resolved `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` in `MSG to MHT` conversion with license set.
- Corrected missing spaces in HTML body content during EML to MSG and HTML-to-text conversions.
- Enforced header count limits in messages to prevent malformed output.

### üîç Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Method**:
  - `FollowUpManager.GetReactions(MapiMessageItemBase message)` ‚Äì returns a list of user reactions on MSG files.
