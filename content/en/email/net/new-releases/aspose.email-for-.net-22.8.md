# Creating Appointment in Office&reg; 365

Ability to create appointment in the Microsoft Office&reg; 365.

# Improved MSG to HTML Conversion

Previously in some instances, the `MSG` to `HTML` conversion generated incorrect output. This issue has now been resolved.

# Better TNEF Attachments Handling

The ability to preserve TNEF attachments in MBOX to PST and PST to MBOX conversions.

```csharp
var reader = new MboxrdStorageReader(fileName, new MboxLoadOptions());
// Read messages preserving tnef attachments.
var eml = reader.ReadNextMessage(new EmlLoadOptions {PreserveTnefAttachments = true});
```

```csharp
MailStorageConverter.MboxMessageOptions(new EmlLoadOptions {PreserveTnefAttachments = true});
// Convert messages from mbox to pst preserving tnef attachments.
var pst = MailStorageConverter.mboxToPst("Input.mbox", "Output.pst");
```

# Enhanced Compatibility of Danish Characters

Previously in some instances it was observed that the Danish characters are being lost after re-saving `MSG`. This issue has now been resolved.
