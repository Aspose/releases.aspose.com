# Better TNEF Handling via API

Previously in some instances, the TNEF (Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format) email attachment format was having issue with plain-text body. This issue has been resolved in the current version of the API.

```csharp
// The path to the File directory.
string dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_Email();

MsgLoadOptions options = new MsgLoadOptions();
options.PreserveTnefAttachments = true;
MailMessage eml = MailMessage.Load(dataDir + "EmbeddedImage1.msg", options);
foreach (Attachment attachment in eml.Attachments)
{
    Console.WriteLine(attachment.Name);
}
```

# Reference Attachment Support

Support for the reference attachments has been implemented in the API. If you want to have a better control over the access of an attachment a reference attachment can be preferable in place of the local file attachments.

```csharp
var eml = MailMessage.Load("fileName");

var refAttach = new ReferenceAttachment("https://[attach_uri]")
{
    Name = "Document.docx",
    ProviderType = AttachmentProviderType.OneDrivePro,
    PermissionType = AttachmentPermissionType.AnyoneCanEdit
};

eml.Attachments.Add(refAttach);

```

# Improved Support for EML to PST Conversion

In some previous instances it was observed that when `EML` files were converted from `PST`, the reference attachments of the emails were not being displayed. This issue has now been resolved.

The following C# code snippet demonstrates simple `EML` to `PST` format conversion via API:

```csharp
using (var message = MailMessage.Load("sourceFile.eml")){
    using (var personalStorage = PersonalStorage.Create("outputFile.pst", FileFormatVersion.Unicode)){

        var inbox = personalStorage.RootFolder.AddSubFolder("Inbox");

        inbox.AddMessage(MapiMessage.FromMailMessage(message, MapiConversionOptions.UnicodeFormat));
	}
}
```
