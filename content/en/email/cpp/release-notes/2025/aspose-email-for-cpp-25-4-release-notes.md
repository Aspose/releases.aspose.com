{{% /alert %}}

Aspose.Email for C++ 25.4 is based on [Aspose.Email for .NET 25.3](/email/net/release-notes/2025/aspose-email-for-net-25-3-release-notes/).

Aspose.Email for C++ does not support asyncronic features of e-mail protocols

## New Enhancements

### Add overload of MapiContact.FromVCard method with VCardLoadOptions parameter

New Overloads:

- Introduced overloads for `FromVCard` that accept `VCardLoadOptions` instead of encoding.
- Deprecated older overloads that use `Encoding`.

**Example:**

```cpp
auto mapiContact = MapiContact::FromVCard(u"contact.vcf", MakeObject<VCardLoadOptions>());
Console::WriteLine(mapiContact->get_NameInfo()->get_DisplayName());
```
