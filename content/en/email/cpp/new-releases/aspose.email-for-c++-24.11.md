#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Email for C++ 24.11 introduces support for accessing user reactions from MSG filesâ€”allowing developers to programmatically retrieve, display, and analyze how users responded to a specific email message. This enables a new level of insight into recipient engagement, useful for applications in feedback tracking, collaboration analytics, or audit logging. This feature is fully supported across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

#### New Feature

- **Retrieve Reactions from MSG Files**: Access user reactions (e.g., likes or emoticons) embedded in MSG messages using a simple API method.
    - New Method: `FollowUpManager::GetReactions(MapiMessageItemBase message)`
    - Returns a list of reactions including user name, email, reaction type, and timestamp.

> Use Case: Automatically collect and analyze reactions to a message for team-based communication insights.

#### Platform Note

All features and updates in this release are equally supported on **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**, with no platform-specific limitations. Performance and functionality remain consistent across environments.
