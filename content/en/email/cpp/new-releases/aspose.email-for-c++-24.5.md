### Enhanced Mbox Reading

Aspose.Email for C++ 24.5 includes the `MboxStorageReader.SplitInto` method that offers better performance and accuracy for splitting Mbox files within your C++ email processing apps.

### Signature Attachment Support

You can easily add signatures when saving email messages and enhance message personalization using the C++ email API.

### Improved ICS to MapiMessage Conversion

We have fixed certain issues in this C++ API release to ensure accurate conversion of dates during the ICS to `MapiMessage` transformation.

### Precise Recurring Task Dates

The `MapiTask` objects now handle recurring dates with greater precision, eliminating calculation errors.

### Additional Bug Fixes

The latest release of the emailing library addresses various bugs related to attachments in HTML output, EWS client contact updates, and EML file loading. You can master email processing in C++ across any platform with this API version.
