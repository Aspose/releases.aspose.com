#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Email for C++ 24.12.1 delivers versatile upgrades for enterprise-grade email processing. It introduces support for reference attachments, enhanced folder message enumeration, and secure GCC High endpoint access via GraphClient. These features improve storage integration, retrieval precision, and security compliance across Windows, Linux, and macOS environments.

#### New Features and Enhancements

- **Reference Attachment Support**: 
  - Overloaded `MapiAttachmentCollection::Add` method to include reference attachments.
  - Introduced `ReferenceAttachmentOptions` class for cloud-based attachment metadata.
  - Use case: Attach Google Drive links as references without file upload.

- **Identify Reference Attachments**:
  - New `MapiAttachment::IsReference` property enables flagging of reference attachments during message processing.

- **FolderInfo Message Enumeration Enhancements**:
  - Retrieve MAPI messages via multiple methods:
    - Filter with `MailQuery`
    - Filter by `MessageKind` type
    - Paginate using `startIndex` and `count` parameters
  - Enables more efficient and targeted message extraction workflows.

- **GCC High Endpoint Support (GraphClient)**:
  - New `EndPoint` property allows secure connectivity to **GCC High** Office 365 Graph endpoints for U.S. government organizations.

> Asynchronous features remain unsupported in the C++ version, consistent with prior releases.

#### Platform Note

All newly introduced features and improvements are fully functional across **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**. Developers on any platform benefit equally from enhanced message enumeration, reference handling, and cloud integration capabilities.
