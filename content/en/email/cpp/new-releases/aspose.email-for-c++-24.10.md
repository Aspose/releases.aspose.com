#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Email for C++ 24.10 introduces a powerful enhancement for Outlook data processing: the ability to retrieve category colors from PST files. Developers can now access detailed category metadataâ€”including names and colorsâ€”and associate them with specific messages, improving message categorization and visual tracking across email archives. This release maintains full cross-platform compatibility on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

#### New Feature

- **Category Color Retrieval from PST Files**: Gain access to the color metadata of Outlook categories directly from PST storage, making it easier to maintain visual consistency and categorize messages effectively.
    - New Enum: `OutlookCategoryColor`
    - New Class: `PstItemCategory`
    - New Method: `List<PstItemCategory> PersonalStorage::GetCategories()`

> Example: Match PST category names to their respective colors for each message using the new API.

#### Platform Note

This feature is fully available on **Windows, Linux, and macOS**. No platform-specific limitations exist, and performance is consistent across all supported systems.

> As with previous versions, **asynchronous email protocol features are not supported** in the C++ edition, even though this release is based on Aspose.Email for .NET 24.9.
