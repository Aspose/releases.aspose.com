Aspose.Email for C++ 24.8 (MSI) brings a suite of updates based on the .NET 24.7 release. This version focuses on expanding compatibility, refining features, and fixing critical bugs. 

### .NET 8 Project Support for Aspose.Email.Printing

With the latest C++ email processing API release, you can work with enhanced compatibility for .NET 8 projects and streamline integration.

### Improved ICS Loading

Developers can now experience efficient handling of ICS files with specific email addresses in their C++ emailing applications.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where splitting PST files threw an exception ("Object reference not set to an instance of an object").
- Resolved problems with MSG to HTML conversion resulting in tapered text.
- Corrected the handling of attachment names with Japanese characters.
- Addressed synchronization issues with `MboxrdStorageReader` for .NET 4.5.
- Fixed `VCardContact` and `RRULE` reading errors.
- Corrected behavior where no changes were saved after modifying the message body.
