#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Email for C++ 25.1 introduces enhanced control over EML message structure through customizable MIME boundary string templates. With the addition of the `BoundariesTemplate` property in `EmlSaveOptions`, developers can now generate structured and consistent boundary strings tailored to specific system or compliance needs. This update is fully supported on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

#### New Feature

- **Custom Boundary Templates for EML Save**:
  - New property: `EmlSaveOptions::BoundariesTemplate`
  - Allows defining the template for MIME part boundary strings using a `{#}` wildcard for incremental numbering.
  - Offers enhanced compatibility with email parsers or MIME-based systems that require standardized formatting.

> Example: Use `boundary--{#}` to auto-generate structured part boundaries like `boundary--1`, `boundary--2` within EML files.

#### Platform Note

This new feature works consistently across **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**, giving developers platform-agnostic control over MIME formatting.
