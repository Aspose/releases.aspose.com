Aspose.Email for Python via .NET 24.7.0 brings new features and essential fixes to allow you to manage emails effectively on macOS x64. Unleash the power of Python and develop high-performance email applications targeting the MacOS platform.

### Email Processing Operations Control

This Python email manipulation API version offers finer control over email processing functionalities with the option to suspend long-running operations using the new `.Abort()` and `.Cancel()` methods.

### Refined Emailing Features

You can effortlessly manage email files in Python as we have introduced several upgrades to the VCF file loading feature, PGP message conversion, soft-deleted item extraction, and high memory usage problems during message transfer on MacOS x64-powered machines.

### Enhanced Email Message Conversions

Equip your email conversion Python applications with the ability to accurately convert emails from one format to the other (MSG to MIME, VCF to Distribution List).
