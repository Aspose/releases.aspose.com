Upgrade your Python applications on macOS ARM64/M1 with the ability to create and manage emails effectively. Aspose.Email for Python via .NET 24.7.0 equips developers with new features and essential bug fixes to unleash Python email power in your solutions.

### Control Email Processing Operations

This release of the Python email manipulation API enables greater control over email processing capabilities with the option to terminate long-running operations using the newly introduced `.Abort()` and `.Cancel()` methods.

### Optimized Emailing Features

Seamlessly handle email files in Python with an updated VCF file loading feature, PGP message conversion, soft-deleted item extraction, and fixes to high memory usage during message transfer on MacOS M1 machines.

### Precise Email Message Conversion

You can now convert emails accurately from one format to the other (MSG to MIME, VCF to Distribution List) in your email conversion Python applications.
