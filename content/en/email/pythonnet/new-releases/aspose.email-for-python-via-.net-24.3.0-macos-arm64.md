Python developers who are working on macOS xARM64/M1 machines can leverage the Outlook data management and additional functionalities provided in Aspose.Email for Python via .NET 24.3.0 to enhance the performance of their email processing applications.

### Strictly Match Container Classes for PST Folders

We have introduced the `EnforceContainerClassMatching` property in `FolderCreationOptions` that allows users to control the handling of PST data by preventing mismatches in container classes while adding folders to PST.

### Extract Category Colors from OLM

Develop powerful solutions that can retrieve category colors associated with Outlook items stored in OLM files. The new `OlmItemCategory` class and `GetCategories` method within `OlmStorage` provided in the latest version of the Python email API help streamline the process on macOS M1 machines.

### Fixed Issues

This release includes various bug fixes related to message body retrieval in `MapiMessage` objects, ICS file import, message file encoding detection, and appointment saving to ICS format.
