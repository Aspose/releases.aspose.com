Aspose.Email for Python via .NET 24.4.0 includes refined functionality and fixes for macOS ARM64/M1 users and further enhances the feature set of our robust email processing library, which helps streamline the development workflows on Apple Macs.

### Upgraded Email Loading

macOS ARM64/M1 users can now experience faster email loading as we have enhanced the functionality of 'MailMessage.Load'. This allows Python developers to upgrade their emailing solutions with ease.

### Better Performance and Stability

With version 24.4.0 of the Python email API, you can enjoy a smooth user experience as we have resolved different problems related to VCF file opening, time zone handling, EMLX validation, and recurrent appointment parsing.
