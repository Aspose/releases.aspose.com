Aspose.Email for Python via .NET 24.4.0 includes refined functionality and fixes for macOS x64 users and further enhances the feature set of our robust email processing library, which helps streamline the development workflows on Apple Macs.

### Email Loading Boost

macOS x64 users can now experience faster email loading as we have enhanced the functionality of 'MailMessage.Load'. This allows Python developers to upgrade their emailing solutions with ease.

### Improved Stability and Performance

With version 24.4.0 of the Python email API, you can enjoy a smooth user experience as we have resolved different problems related to VCF file opening, time zone handling, EMLX validation, and recurrent appointment parsing.
