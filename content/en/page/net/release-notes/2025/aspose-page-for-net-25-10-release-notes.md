## Improvements and Changes

Now saving XPS as image files can be done in 2 lines.
Either this:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
//Save XPS document as image files in the folder where input XPS file is located with the name of this XPS file with index of page suffix.
XpsDocument document = new XpsDocument(xpsFilePath);
document.SaveAsImage(new JpegSaveOption());
{{< /highlight >}}

or that:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
//Save XPS document as image files in the assigned folder and file name template.
//Index of the page will be added as a suffix to file name template and the extension will be obtained from the save options. 
XpsDocument document = new XpsDocument(xpsFilePath);
document.SaveAsImage(new PngSaveOption(), outputDir, fileNameTemplate);
{{< /highlight >}}
