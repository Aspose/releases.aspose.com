#### Release Highlights

The DLLs-only release of Aspose.Page for .NET 24.12 improves reliability in PostScript conversions and introduces fallback handling for corrupted fonts.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Font Substitution for Broken Embeds**: Implemented a mechanism to replace corrupted embedded fonts with valid substitutes to ensure uninterrupted text rendering during output generation.

### üîß Enhancement

- *No standalone enhancements outside the new feature.*

### üõ† Fix

- **Page Content Not Rendered**: Resolved a bug affecting PostScript files where inconsistent page dimensions between `save` and `restore` operations caused missing content.
- **PDF Conversion Failures for Printer PS Files**: Fixed errors encountered when converting certain PS files generated by printers.
- **Embedded Font Extraction Failure**: Corrected issues where font data could not be retrieved for rendering in PDFs.
- **Font Dropout in OutputStream**: Fixed rendering gaps where certain fonts were completely missing in the generated PDF.
- **Legacy Profile Compatibility**: Addressed incompatibility with maximum profile versions from older versions (e.g., Aspose.Page 20.11).
- **Missing Text & Blank Output**:
  - Fixed scenarios where converting PS files to PDF resulted in incomplete or empty output.
