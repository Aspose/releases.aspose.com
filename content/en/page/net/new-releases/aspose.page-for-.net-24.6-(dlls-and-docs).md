This release of Aspose.Page for .NET 24.6 (DLLs and Docs) brings the same exciting new features and enhancements as the MSI version, alongside essential bug fixes to simplify integration and your document processing workflows.

### Enhanced Color Space Support

The XPS and PS processing API now provides robust CIE-based color space support for your C# apps and offers better precision and color fidelity during document conversion.

### Improved XPS to PDF Conversion

We have optimized the XPS to PDF conversion functionality by resolving the issues related to generating large files while using the Calibri font. This upgrade ascertains accurate file sizes without compromising quality.

### Smooth PS to PDF Conversion

Aspose.Page for .NET 24.6 offers augmented multi-page handling and color rendering while converting PS to PDF documents, delivering precise and consistent output.

### Lightning Fast PS to JPEG Conversion

Enjoy a notable performance boost while converting PostScript files to JPEG images within your C# and VB.NET document conversion solutions. With this optimization, we have reduced processing time and improved overall efficiency.

### Extended PS Image Conversion

Version 24.6 of the .NET library lets you convert a broader range of PS image formats to JPEG images and broadens your document processing capabilities on Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms.

### Updated EPS Processing

The ability to run external EPS files directly from processed PostScript files has been added, and it simplifies your workflows and eliminates the need for manual intervention.
