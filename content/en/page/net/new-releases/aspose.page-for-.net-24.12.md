#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Page for .NET 24.12 introduces robust font substitution for corrupted embedded fonts and resolves critical bugs that previously prevented accurate PostScript-to-PDF and image conversions.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Corrupted Font Substitution**: Added support for automatically replacing unreadable or damaged embedded fonts during rendering. This enhancement ensures PDF output remains complete even when font data is partially corrupt or missing.

### üîß Enhancement

- *No general enhancements introduced beyond new feature capabilities.*

### üõ† Fix

- **PS to Image Rendering**: Fixed a bug where page content failed to render due to inconsistent page sizing between `save` and `restore` instructions in PostScript.
- **Printer-Generated PS to PDF Issue**: Resolved failures in converting certain printer-generated PS files to PDF.
- **Font Extraction Bug**: Corrected issues where embedded fonts could not be extracted during PS to PDF conversion.
- **Missing Fonts in PDF Output**: Addressed cases where certain fonts were not appearing in the final PDF stream.
- **Unsupported Profile Version**: Fixed an issue related to an outdated maximum profile version introduced in legacy releases.
- **Text and Page Content Loss**:
  - Resolved bugs where specific PS files resulted in missing text or blank pages when converted to PDF.
