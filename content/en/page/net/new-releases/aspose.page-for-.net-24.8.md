We are excited to announce the release of Aspose.Page for .NET 24.8 (MSI installer)! This update equips the .NET developers with improved XPS to PDF conversions, along with enhanced control and smaller file sizes.

### Faster XPS to PDF Conversion

The .NET XPS file manipulation API now utilizes a pipelined approach for XPS to PDF conversions, resulting in a noticeable speed boost for your C# applications on Windows.

### Event-Based XPS Conversion Control

You can gain finer control over the XPS to PDF conversion process with the introduction of event-based operations on XPS pages in version 24.8 of Aspose.Page for .NET.

### Improved Image Compression in PDF

Work with a reduced size of saved image bytes within your generated PDF documents in this .NET API version, thanks to the optimized image compression algorithms.
