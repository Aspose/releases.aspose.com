Aspose.Page for .NET 24.6 (MSI installer) has been released! This update delivers new features and a range of enhancements focused on color accuracy, conversion optimization, and bug resolution for the Windows platform.

### Accurate Color Reproduction

The latest XPS and PS processing API version offers robust CIE-based color space support for your C# apps, providing greater precision and color fidelity during document conversion.

### XPS to PDF Conversion Enhancements

Experience optimized XPS to PDF conversion after we fixed the issues related to generating unexpectedly large files when using the Calibri font. This optimization ensures efficient file sizes without compromising quality.

### Streamlined PS to PDF Conversion

Another enhancement added to Aspose.Page for .NET 24.6 is the multi-page handling and color rendering during PS to PDF conversion, delivering accurate and consistent output.

### Faster PS to JPEG Conversion

Developers can enjoy significant performance gains when converting PostScript files to JPEG images within their C# and VB.NET document conversion applications. This optimization reduces processing time and improves overall efficiency.

### Broader PS Image Conversion

Using this version of the .NET library, you can convert a wider range of PS image formats to JPEG images and expand your document processing capabilities on the Windows platform.

### Supercharged EPS Processing

We have implemented the ability to run external EPS files directly from processed PostScript files, simplifying your workflow and eliminating the need for manual intervention.
