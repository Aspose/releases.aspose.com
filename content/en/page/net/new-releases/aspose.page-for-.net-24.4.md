We are glad to announce the release of Aspose.Page for .NET 24.4 (MSI). This version includes .NET Core 2.0 and .NET 7 support, expanding your compatibility and integration across multiple frameworks. 

### Broader .NET Framework Support

.NET developers can now easily integrate with .NET Core 2.0 and .NET 7 and experience greater flexibility, eliminating the need for `System.Drawing` dependency for your XPS manipulation apps running on the Windows platform.

### Streamlined Development

By removing the `System.Drawing` dependency, this release simplifies application development and reduces potential compatibility issues for your C# and VB.NET apps.
