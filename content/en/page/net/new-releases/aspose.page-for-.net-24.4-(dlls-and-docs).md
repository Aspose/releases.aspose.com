We are thrilled to announce the release of Aspose.Page for .NET 24.4 (DLLs and Docs package), offering valuable enhancements for your .NET projects.

### Improved Framework Compatibility

Developers can now integrate with .NET Core 2.0 and .NET 7 and experience broader flexibility, removing the `System.Drawing` dependency for their XPS manipulation apps on any platform.

### Simplified Development Process

We have removed the `System.Drawing` dependency in this release, which simplifies application development and reduces any compatibility issues for your C# and VB.NET applications.
