This version of Aspose.Page for C++ (macOS) equips developers with upgraded image processing and rendering features. They can leverage the newly added capabilities to achieve better image quality on the macOS systems.

### Supercharged Image Save Options

In the latest C++ library release, we have introduced `Aspose::Page::EPS::Device::ImageSaveOptions` class, which provides finer control over image resolution and format while saving the image files.

### Enhanced Rendering Control

The `Aspose::Page::Drawing::Drawing2D::SmoothingMode` enumeration added in Aspose.Page for C++ 24.4 allows macOS developers to specify various image smoothing algorithms to enhance rendering quality. 

### EPS to PDF Conversion

Export EPS documents to PDF format effortlessly within your C++ XPS processing applications using the `Aspose::Page::EPS::PsDocument::SaveAsPdf` method in the latest API release.

### Public API Changes

### Added APIs
Some of the API members added in the latest XPS file processing API release are given below:
- Aspose::Page::Drawing::Drawing2D::SmoothingMode
- Aspose::Page::EPS::PsDocument::SaveAsPdf
- Aspose::Page::EPS::PsDocument::SaveAsImage
- Aspose::Page::EPS::Device::ImageSaveOptions::#ctor (multiple overloads for size, format, and resolution)

### Deprecated APIs

The following classes and members are deprecated and will be hidden in version 24.6 of Aspose.Page for C++. Please consider using the new `Aspose::Page::EPS::Device::ImageSaveOptions` class instead:
- Aspose::Page::Device class.
- Aspose::Page::EPS::PdfDevice class.
- Aspose::Page::EPS::ImageDevice class.
- Aspose::Page::XPS::Presentation::Pdf::PdfDevice class.
- Aspose::Page::XPS::Presentation::Image::ImageDevice class.
- Aspose::Page::EPS::PsDocument::Save(System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Page::Device>, Aspose::Page::SaveOptions) method.

### Removed APIs

A few of the API members that were removed from the latest release of Aspose.Page for C++ library are shared below:
- Constructors and destructor methods from the `Aspose::Page::Device` class.
- Properties and methods related to device properties, creator, save options, size, and other rendering aspects from the `Aspose::Page::Device` class.
