This release of Aspose.Page for C++ (version 24.4) includes exciting image processing and rendering enhancements. C++ developers can now utilize new features and achieve finer quality image output on the Windows and macOS platforms.

### Upgraded Image Save Options

We have introduced `Aspose::Page::EPS::Device::ImageSaveOptions` class in this C++ library release, which provides better control over image resolution and format during saving operations.

### Smoother Rendering Control

The addition of the `Aspose::Page::Drawing::Drawing2D::SmoothingMode` enumeration in Aspose.Page for C++ 24.4 allows developers to apply different image smoothing algorithms for enhanced rendering quality. 

### EPS to PDF Export

C++ developers can now directly export EPS documents to PDF format within their XPS processing apps using the `Aspose::Page::EPS::PsDocument::SaveAsPdf` method in this API version.

### Public API Changes

### Added APIs
Some of the API members added in the latest XPS file processing API release are given below:
- Aspose::Page::Drawing::Drawing2D::SmoothingMode
- Aspose::Page::EPS::PsDocument::SaveAsPdf
- Aspose::Page::EPS::PsDocument::SaveAsImage
- Aspose::Page::EPS::Device::ImageSaveOptions::#ctor (multiple overloads for size, format, and resolution)

### Deprecated APIs

The following classes and members are deprecated and will be hidden in version 24.6 of Aspose.Page for C++. Please consider using the new `Aspose::Page::EPS::Device::ImageSaveOptions` class instead:
- Aspose::Page::Device class.
- Aspose::Page::EPS::PdfDevice class.
- Aspose::Page::EPS::ImageDevice class.
- Aspose::Page::XPS::Presentation::Pdf::PdfDevice class.
- Aspose::Page::XPS::Presentation::Image::ImageDevice class.
- Aspose::Page::EPS::PsDocument::Save(System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Page::Device>, Aspose::Page::SaveOptions) method.

### Removed APIs

A few of the API members that were removed from the latest release of Aspose.Page for C++ library are shared below:
- Constructors and destructor methods from the `Aspose::Page::Device` class.
- Properties and methods related to device properties, creator, save options, size, and other rendering aspects from the `Aspose::Page::Device` class.
