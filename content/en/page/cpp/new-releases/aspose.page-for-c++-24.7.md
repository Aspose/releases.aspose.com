This update to Aspose.Page for C++ (v24.7) brings exciting news for developers working with PostScript (PS), Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), and XPS files. We have incorporated a powerful new feature, Extract Text, to simplify the text retrieval capabilities of your platform-independent C++ applications.

### Effortless Text Extraction 

The new `ExtractText` method in this release of the C++ XPS file manipulation API allows developers to build powerful text extraction applications to efficiently retrieve text from PS, EPS, and XPS files.

### Simplified Workflows

Save development time and resources by leveraging the new features available in version 24.7 of the native C++ library across Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms.
