## **Aspose.Page for C++ has been launched!**
We are pleased to announce the launch of [Aspose.Page for C++](https://products.aspose.com/page/cpp) API. It offers a complete set of features to create, read, modify and convert XPS and EPS documents in C++ applications. This first version of the API implements the full functionality of Aspose.Page for .NET which is serving customers for quite a long time now. Using this API, you can develop native C++ applications and deploy them on server or user computers without the need to install any other software applications.
