#### Release Highlights

The DLLs-only package of Aspose.PSD for .NET 25.1 offers advanced SmartObject replacement logic and improved rendering support for intersecting paths in AI designs.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

### üîß Enhancement

- *(No enhancements in this release)*

### üõ† Fix

- Fixed an issue in Adobe Illustrator (.AI) rendering where **intersecting paths were misdrawn**, improving fidelity for multi-page or vector-heavy designs.
