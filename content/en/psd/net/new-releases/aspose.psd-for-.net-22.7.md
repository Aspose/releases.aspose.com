# Support for PSD Plug-In Resource

Added the support of PSD Image Section Resource 4000-4999; i.e. the plug-In resource(s).

# Improved PSD File Size Optimization

Previously when an PSD file with subfolders was exported, it was noticed that its size has increased. In the current version of the API this issue has been addressed and resolved. Also in some cases, once the PSD file was exported its result was much larger than the source file. This issue has also been fixed.
