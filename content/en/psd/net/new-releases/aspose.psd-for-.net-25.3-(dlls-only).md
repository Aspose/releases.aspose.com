#### Release Highlights

The DLLs-only package of Aspose.PSD for .NET 25.3 stabilizes rendering regressions introduced in prior updates and improves the accuracy and uniformity of blending across PSD and AI layers.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- *(No new APIs or features added in this version)*

### üîß Enhancement

- **Improved Blending Method**: Introduced a **unified blending model** that ensures more reliable and consistent composite output for PSD layers with complex blending scenarios.

### üõ† Fix

- Fixed an APS rendering issue that caused improper path visuals or distortions in `.ai` files using short curves or compound paths.
- Resolved AI rendering failures where layers or elements were not processed due to structural regression in `.ai` interpretation.
