#### Release Highlights

Aspose.PSD for .NET 24.9 DLLs-only package improves rendering efficiency for AI files and adds robust artboard layer support, while also fixing several critical layer parsing bugs.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Artboard Resource APIs**: Now supports `ArtBResource`, `ArtDResource`, `AbddResource`, and `LyvrResource` for **full artboard layer compatibility** via public API access.

### üîß Enhancement

- **APS-Based AI Rendering**: Speeds up loading of `.ai` files by switching to APS conversion for more responsive processing.

### üõ† Fix

- Fixed incorrect Fill layer detection in shape-based PSD files.
- Eliminated crashes during TextLayer manipulation involving large or complex documents.
- Resolved exceptions from reading embedded `FillLayer` streams in reports.
- Corrected parsing of invalid or malformed color values in PSD files.
- Addressed failure when accessing layers beyond index 99 in specific documents.
- Enhanced loading speed of AI files previously delayed by rendering inefficiencies.
