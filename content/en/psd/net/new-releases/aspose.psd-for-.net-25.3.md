#### Release Highlights

Aspose.PSD for .NET 25.3 focuses on stabilizing APS and AI rendering after regression issues and introduces a more consistent and accurate blending algorithm across PSD formats.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- *(No new features introduced in this release)*

### üîß Enhancement

- **Unified Blending System**: Reworked blending logic to provide **smoother visual transitions** across layers and formats‚Äîresulting in more consistent rendering between PSD, AI, and output formats.

### üõ† Fix

- **APS Rendering Regression**: Fixed visual distortions and path handling introduced after APS renderer integration in recent versions.
- **AI Rendering Regression**: Corrected layer and object visibility problems in `.ai` files affected by previous format updates.
