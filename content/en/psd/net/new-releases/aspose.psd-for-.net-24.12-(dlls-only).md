#### Release Highlights

Aspose.PSD for .NET 24.12 DLLs package provides refined rendering for AI files, including axial shading, blending, and compound path support. PSD-specific improvements cover shape stroke rendering and dual mask logic.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **AI Format Upgrades**:
  - Added **Axial Shading (Type 2)** and **Freeform Shading (Type 7)**.
  - Implemented **blend mode support** for enhanced AI visual fidelity.
  - Introduced `PageCount` for rendering multi-page `.ai` files with `ActivePageIndex`.

- **PSD Layer Enhancement**:
  - Enabled rendering of Shape layers with **both vector and raster masks**.

### üîß Enhancement

- **LayerResource Refactor**: Simplified constructors and removed obsolete properties for better performance and clarity.
- **APS-Based Compound Paths**: Improved complex shape rendering in `.ai` using the new APS compound path engine.

### üõ† Fix

- Fixed clipped strokes in Shape layers saved from older Photoshop versions.
- Resolved rendering errors in AI files with missing or malformed OCG/layer data.
- Corrected null `GlobalResources` in newly created PSDs to prevent SmartObject crashes.
- Improved compatibility for AI files with non-standard page property dictionaries.
