#### Release Highlights

Aspose.PSD for .NET 24.12 adds advanced support for AI shading, compound paths, and multi-page handling. It also enhances PSD shape rendering and corrects SmartObject resource initialization.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **AI Gradient Shading Support**: Implemented **Axial (Type 2)** and **Freeform (Type 7)** gradient shading in `.ai` files.
- **AI Blending**: Added support for Adobe Illustrator **blending modes** during rendering.
- **Multi-Page AI Reading**: Introduced `AiImage.PageCount` and multi-page rendering for `.ai` documents.
- **Vector + Raster Mask Handling**: PSD Shape layers with combined **vector and raster masks** are now properly rendered.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Refactored LayerResources**: Optimized internal structure by removing rarely used properties and simplifying resource constructors.
- **APS Compound Paths**: Reworked AI Compound Path rendering through **APS engine** for increased accuracy.

### üõ† Fix

- Fixed rendering issues with **Shape layers** from legacy PSDs (e.g., stroke clipping and effects loss).
- Improved handling of AI files lacking proper `OCG` layer data or using unusual `DictionaryObject` structures for page layers.
- Ensured `GlobalResources` are initialized for new PSD files to avoid SmartObject exceptions.
