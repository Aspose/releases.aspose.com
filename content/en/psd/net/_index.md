```csharp
// Implement correct Crop method for PSD files.
using (RasterImage image = Image.Load(dir + "template.psd") as RasterImage)
{
    image.Crop(new Rectangle(10, 30, 100, 100));
    image.Save(dir + "output.png", new PngOptions() { ColorType = PngColorType.TruecolorWithAlpha });
}
```

## Draw Rectangles in a PSD Image

```csharp
// Create an instance of Image
using (Image image = new PsdImage(100, 100))
{
    Graphics graphic = new Graphics(image);
    graphic.Clear(Color.Yellow);
    // Draw a rectangle with Pen tool
    graphic.DrawRectangle(new Pen(Color.Red), new Rectangle(30, 10, 40, 80));
    // Draw another rectangle with Solid Brush in Blue color
    graphic.DrawRectangle(new Pen(new SolidBrush(Color.Blue)), new Rectangle(10, 30, 80, 40));
}
```
