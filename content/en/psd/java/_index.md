## Create a PSD from Scratch

```java
PsdImage psdImage = new PsdImage(300, 300);

// fill image data.
Graphics graphics = new Graphics(psdImage);
graphics.clear(Color.getWhite());
Pen pen = new Pen(Color.getBrown());
graphics.drawRectangle(pen, bmpImage.getBounds());

// create an instance of PsdOptions, Set it's various properties Save image to disk in PSD format
PsdOptions psdOptions = new PsdOptions();
psdOptions.setColorMode(ColorModes.Rgb);
psdOptions.setCompressionMethod(CompressionMethod.Raw);
psdOptions.setVersion(4);
bmpImage.save("output.psd", psdOptions);
```
