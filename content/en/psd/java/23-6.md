# What's new in the Aspose.PSD for Java 23.6

## Release Highlights

Aspose.PSD for Java 23.6 introduces a powerful animation export engine with PSD-to-GIF conversion, adds full support for `ShapeLayer`, `ThresholdLayer`, and `SelectiveColorLayer`, and optimizes warp rendering. It also improves handling of `TextLayer` formatting and SmartObject updates.

## New Features

- **Animated GIF Export**
  Export PSD timeline frames directly to animated GIF using the new `Timeline.save()` method.

- **ShapeLayer Support**
  New API capabilities allow reading and modifying `ShapeLayer` paths programmatically.

- **Threshold and Selective Color Layers**
  Full read/write support for `ThresholdLayer` and `SelectiveColorLayer` objects with CMYK control.

- **TextLayer Without Bounds**
  Added capability to add or manage `TextLayer` without requiring a defined rectangular boundary.

## Enhancements

- **Warp Rendering Optimization**
  Enhanced rendering speed and reduced artifacts in warped layers.

- **Timeline API Refactoring**
  Timeline API redesigned for better frame and state manipulation of PSD animations.

## Bug Fixes

- **Smart Object Update**
  Replacing the contents of a SmartObject now updates the embedded layer properly.

- **Save/Load Exceptions Resolved**
  Fixed issues with saving PSDs in certain color modes, and loading ShapeLayer or vector paths with specific structures.

- **Text Justification Loss**
  Resolved issue where text justification settings were lost when editing in Photoshop.

- **Null Reference Exception on Save**
  Fixed crash when saving PSD with updated text layer.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Added APIs**
  - `PsdImage.getTimeline()` for animation handling
  - `addThresholdAdjustmentLayer()` and `addSelectiveColorAdjustmentLayer()` methods
  - `ShapeLayer`, `ThresholdLayer`, `SelectiveColorLayer`, `OuterGlowEffect`, and supporting classes
  - Full animation API including `Timeline`, `Frame`, `LayerState`, `LayerStateEffects`

- **Removed APIs**
  - Deprecated `Lr16Resource` and `Lr32Resource` classes replaced by `LrXxResource`
