# What's new in the Aspose.PSD for Java 24.2

## Release Highlights

Aspose.PSD for Java 24.2 delivers enhanced text formatting and fill capabilities, including **Pattern Fill angle rotation** and **TextLayer scaling**. It improves **AI format rendering**, warp performance, and resolves critical bugs in PSD stroke patterns and smart object text styles.

## New Features

- **Pattern Fill Angle Support**
  - Added `setAngle(double)` support to `PatternFillSettings` for better control over fill rotation.

- **Horizontal and Vertical Scaling for TextLayer**
  - Enables more precise text layout customization.

- **AI Format: PDF-Based Background Rendering**
  - Improved rendering accuracy for PDF-based AI files with proper background layer handling.

## Enhancements

- **Warp Distortion Engine Improvements**
  - Refined distortion mechanics and accelerated warp processing during PSD rendering.

## Bug Fixes

- **Exception During AI Image Load**
  - Fixed various “Image loading failed” errors when opening complex `.ai` files.

- **PSD Stroke Pattern Save Issue**
  - Resolved incorrect behavior when saving stroke patterns in PSD files.

- **Incorrect Text Style in Smart Object after ReplaceContents**
  - Ensures text styles are retained when replacing smart object contents.

- **Cubic Bezier Rendering in AI Files**
  - Fixed rendering glitches for Bezier curves in `.ai` vector artwork.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Added**
  - `FillLayer` class and associated methods for fill manipulation
  - `PtFlResource.getAngle()` and `setAngle(double)` for pattern fill angle control
  - `AiImage.getActivePageIndex()` and `setActivePageIndex(int)` for AI multipage handling

- **Removed**
  - Deprecated `filllayers.FillLayer` class and its members
