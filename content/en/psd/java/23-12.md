# What's new in the Aspose.PSD for Java 23.12

## Release Highlights

Aspose.PSD for Java 23.12 delivers advanced gradient noise fill support, enhanced cross-platform font handling, and new AI image rendering capabilities. This release also introduces the ability to embed any image as a smart object in PSD files and resolves critical bugs affecting text layer updates and warp rendering.

## New Features

- **Raster Rendering in AI Files**
  Adds support for rendering embedded raster images in modern PDF-based AI formats.

- **Noise Gradient Fill Support**
  Enables creation and editing of noise-based gradients using `GdFlResource` and `NoiseGradientFillSettings`.

- **Smart Object Embedding**
  Allows loading any image format into a PSD as an embedded `SmartObjectLayer`.

## Enhancements

- **Cross-Reference Streams in AI**
  Enhanced AI format handling with support for PostScript cross-reference streams.

- **Improved Licensing Control**
  Fixes incorrect license behavior affecting `VectorPathDataResource`.

## Bug Fixes

- **Text Layer Save Crash**
  Fixes a null reference exception when saving updated text layers.

- **Mac Font Handling**
  Resolves font loading issues on macOS using `System.Drawing.Common` and `Aspose.Drawing`.

- **Warp Rendering Exception**
  Resolved a crash triggered by `AllowWarpRepaint` option during PSD loading.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Added APIs**
  - Full API set for `NoiseGradientFillSettings` and `GdFlResource`
  - `SmartObjectLayer` constructor from stream
  - Cross-platform font cache and interpolation management

- **Removed APIs**
  - Legacy gradient properties in `GradientFillSettings`
  - Several `IGradientFillSettings` and `IFillSettings` methods
