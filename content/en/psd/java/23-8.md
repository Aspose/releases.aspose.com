## Release Highlights

Aspose.PSD for Java 23.8 adds advanced warp types such as Flag, Arc Up/Down, and Sphere to enhance layer distortion capabilities.

Additionally, several critical bugs affecting PSD integrity and load reliability have been resolved.

## Bug Fixes

- **Loading Failures and Cast Exceptions**
  Resolved image loading errors due to structure type mismatches and third-party file modifications.

  PSDs that previously failed to load or crashed during save now process successfully, aligning with Photoshop compatibility.
