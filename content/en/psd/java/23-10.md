# What's new in the Aspose.PSD for Java 23.10

## Release Highlights

Aspose.PSD for Java 23.10 delivers support for vertical text layout, advanced shape stroke rendering using `vstk` resources, and optimized saving for unchanged shape layers. Developers also gain AI format (PDF-based) header reading, accurate PSD resolution control, and reliable font mapping with custom font folders. Several critical bugs were resolved to improve stability and output fidelity.

## New Features

- **Vertical Text Direction**
  Introduced support for rendering vertical text in PSD files, enhancing multilingual and Asian typography use cases.

- **Advanced Shape Stroke Rendering**
  Enabled stroke rendering via `vstk` resources and full stroke fill control for shape layers.

- **Optimized Shape Layer Saving**
  Prevents unnecessary redraws of shape layers unless modified, improving performance.

- **AI Format Header Support**
  Allows reading PDF-based Adobe Illustrator (AI) file headers and bounding boxes.

## Bug Fixes

- **PSD Resolution Not Set Properly**
  Resolved issues where various methods failed to apply custom resolution to new PSDs.

- **Font Folders Ignored**
  Fixed bug where `FontSettings.setFontsFolders()` did not apply correct fonts.

- **Null Reference on Save with ShapeLayer**
  Prevented exception when saving PSDs containing shape layers with uninitialized data.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Added APIs**
  - `PsdImage.setResolution(double, double)`
  - `FontSettings.getGetSystemAlternativeFont()`
  - `FontSettings.setGetSystemAlternativeFont(boolean)`
  - `ShapeLayer.getStroke()` / `setStroke(IStrokeSettings)`
  - New stroke-related classes and interfaces (`StrokeSettings`, `IStrokeSettings`, etc.)

- **Removed APIs**
  - Deprecated `memberwiseClone()` methods from various `ImageOptions`
  - `Image.isAutoAdjustPalette()` (replaced with new accessor)
