- **Shape Layer Mask Handling**
  Added support for shape layers with both vector and raster masks in PSD files.

## Enhancements

- **AI Compound Path Rendering**
  Refactored compound path logic to use APS rendering for better compatibility.

- **LayerResource Refactoring**
  Optimized internal dependencies by decoupling rarely used properties.

## Bug Fixes
