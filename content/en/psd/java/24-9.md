# What's new in the Aspose.PSD for Java 24.9

## Release Highlights

Aspose.PSD for Java 24.9 enhances performance and compatibility with Adobe Illustrator and PSD formats. This release adds support for advanced artboard metadata (`artb`, `artd`, `abdd`, `lyvr`), significantly reduces AI file load times, and fixes multiple layer-related bugs for better reliability across platforms.

## New Features

- **Artboard Resource Support**
  Introduced support for `artb`, `artd`, `abdd`, and `lyvr` resources, improving artboard compatibility for layered PSD files.

## Enhancements

- **Faster AI File Loading**
  Replaced standard AI rendering with APS-based conversion to improve load performance for large vector files.

## Bug Fixes

- **Fill Layer Detection Issue**
  Resolved a bug where certain `FillLayer` elements were not recognized correctly during parsing.

- **AI File Load Performance Regression**
  Fixed excessive loading times for AI files with complex content streams.

- **Invalid Color Value Exception**
  Corrected exception handling when parsing text layers with malformed color properties.

- **Index Out of Range on Layer Iteration**
  Fixed an issue that caused iteration failures on specific PSD files after 24.7 update.

- **Embedded FillLayer Stream Failure**
  Ensured embedded FillLayer streams load correctly from input sources.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Classes**
  - `com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.layers.layerresources.artboardresources.BaseArtboardInfoResource`
  - `ArtBResource`, `ArtDResource`, `AbddResource`
  - `com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.layers.layerresources.LyvrResource`

- **New Methods**
  - `LayerResource.#ctor(int)`
  - `BaseArtboardInfoResource.getLength()`, `save()`, `getItems()`, etc.
  - `LyvrResource.getVersion()`, `save()`, `getLength()`
