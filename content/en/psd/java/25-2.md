This release also adds **Noise Gradient editing** in layer effects and improves the **performance of mask processing**, enhancing speed and flexibility for large design automation and image manipulation tasks.

## New Features

- **Support for Saving PSB Files >2GB**
  - Now you can create and export extremely large PSB files for advanced design scenarios and industrial-scale graphic applications.

- **Noise Gradient Handling in Layer Effects**
  - Implemented support for editing and applying noise-based gradients in stroke and overlay effects, giving designers more control over visual complexity.

## Enhancements

- **Optimized Mask Processing**
  - Improved internal mask rendering and handling, reducing memory and CPU consumption for large layered images.

## Bug Fixes

- **Fixed PSB Save Exception Over 1GB**
  - Resolved an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` that occurred when saving large PSB files.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

### ✅ Added APIs

- `GradientFillSettings.getColor()`
- `GradientFillSettings.setColor(Color)`
- `IGradientFillSettings.getGradientName()`
- `IGradientFillSettings.setGradientName(String)`
- `GradientOverlayEffect.setSettings(BaseGradientFillSettings)`
- `GradientOverlayEffect.setSettings(GradientFillSettings)`
- `GradientMapLayer.update()`
- `BaseGradientFillSettings(Color)`, `getColor()`, `setColor(Color)`
