# What's new in the Aspose.PSD for Java 24.6

## Release Highlights

Aspose.PSD for Java 24.6 brings powerful new features including full support for Gradient Map adjustment layers, XMP metadata in AI files, and newly implemented warp styles like Inflate, Squeeze, and Twist. It also delivers improved file processing for expanded canvas images, ArtBoard layers, and large PSD save operations.

## New Features

- **Gradient Map Adjustment Layer**
  - Added support for creating and editing Gradient Map layers with fine-tuned gradient settings.

- **AI Format XMP Metadata Support**
  - Now reads embedded XPacket metadata from Adobe Illustrator files via `getXmpData()`.

- **New Warp Types**
  - Introduced support for new warp transformations: Inflate, Squeeze (vertical & horizontal), and Twist.

## Bug Fixes

- **Canvas Overflow Preservation**
  - Fixed issue where image data beyond canvas bounds was being cropped after saving.

- **ArtBoard RGB/Lab Mode Fix**
  - Corrected channel constraints for ArtBoard-enabled RGB and Lab mode documents.

- **Negative Area Exception Resolved**
  - Fixed `areaToProcess` exception during PSD rendering with certain layers.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Added APIs**
  - `PsdImage.addGradientMapAdjustmentLayer()`
  - `GradientMapLayer.getGradientSettings()/setGradientSettings(...)`
  - `AiImage.getXmpData()`
  - `GradientHelper` utility class and gradient model constants

- **Removed APIs**
  - `GdflResourceHelper` (replaced with `GradientHelper`)
  - Deprecated `GradientFillSettings.getGradientName/setGradientName(String)`
