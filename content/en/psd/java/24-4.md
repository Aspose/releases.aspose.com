## Release Highlights

Aspose.PSD for Java 24.4 brings key new features including Shape Layer creation via API and support for `XObjectForm` resources in Adobe Illustrator (AI) files. This release also fixes CMYK export issues and stabilizes license setting logic.

## Bug Fixes

  - You can now safely call `license.setLicense()` multiple times without error.

  - Ensures accurate conversion from RGB to CMYK with correct transparency and channel count.

- **PSD Save Compatibility**
  - Fixed export failure for specific PSDs that previously caused errors.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Added APIs**
  - `PsdImage.addShapeLayer()`: Creates a new `ShapeLayer` programmatically.
