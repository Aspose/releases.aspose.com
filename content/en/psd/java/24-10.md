# What's new in the Aspose.PSD for Java 24.10

## Release Highlights

Aspose.PSD for Java 24.10 focuses on performance and stability improvements. It optimizes gradient rendering, enhances multiline text updates, and resolves critical issues related to smart objects, clipping masks, and PSD parsing errors in complex layered files.

## New Features

- **NoiseColorModel Enum for Gradients**
  Introduced `NoiseColorModel` with support for `RGB`, `HSB`, and `LAB` models, improving control over noise gradient effects.

## Enhancements

- **Gradient Rendering Optimization**
  Gradient layer rendering is now significantly faster, especially in unlicensed environments, reducing export time for large PSDs.

## Bug Fixes

- **Multiline Text Update Issue**
  Resolved an exception when updating `TextLayer` content with multiple newline characters.

- **SmartObjectLayer Embedded Image Issue**
  Fixed a bug where adding an embedded smart object from external images failed in PSD files.

- **Clipping Mask Processing Failure**
  Eliminated processing exceptions for large images with nested clipping masks.

- **Gradient Shape Loading Error**
  Fixed an exception triggered when loading PSD files with noise gradient shapes and strokes.

- **Text Truncation on Update**
  Solved a problem where the last character was missing after updating text layers.

- **ReplaceContents Null Reference**
  Fixed `NullReferenceException` during smart object replacement after editing in third-party tools.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Enum**
  - `com.aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.layers.gradient.NoiseColorModel` with values: `RGB`, `HSB`, `LAB`

- **Updated Methods**
  - `BaseGradientFillSettings.getColor()` and `setColor(Color)` added
  - Obsolete methods `GradientFillSettings.getColor()` and `setColor(Color)` removed
