  Enables rendering of PDF-based AI files and interprets the "cm" PostScript operator for accurate visuals.

## Bug Fixes

  Fixed an issue causing `System.ArgumentNullException` when fetching fonts from text layers.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Added APIs**
  - `FontSettings.removeFontCacheFile()`

  - New `ColorSpace` enum values (`RGB`, `HSB`, `CMYK`, etc.)
