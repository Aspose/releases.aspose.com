# What's new in the Aspose.PSD for Java 24.11

## Release Highlights

Aspose.PSD for Java 24.11 introduces support for `ArtboardLayer`, allowing precise artboard management and export. It also enhances the flexibility of `FillSettings` replacement and stabilizes AI and PSD file parsing for edge-case structures and unit types.

## New Features

- **Artboard Layer Support**
  Added `ArtboardLayer` class to access, configure, and export PSD artboards with defined boundaries and background colors.

- **Dynamic FillSettings Conversion**
  Introduced accurate behavior for changing `FillSettings` types (e.g., Gradient to Solid), ensuring layer resources are updated accordingly.

## Enhancements

- **Improved Unit Handling**
  Added support for `UnitTypes.Millimeters` in vector origin bounds, improving compatibility with millimeter-based PSD files.

## Bug Fixes

- **AI Files Without Layers**
  Resolved issue with AI files lacking OCG (layer groups), ensuring rendering proceeds without error.

- **FillLayer Update Errors**
  Fixed multiple issues where FillLayer settings could not be updated correctly or caused rendering inconsistencies.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Public Types and Methods**
  - `ArtboardLayer` with properties like `getTop()`, `getLeft()`, `getBackgroundColor()`, and `save(...)`.
  - Added `UnitTypes.Millimeters` to `TypeToolInfoResource`.

- **Constructor Updates**
  - Overloaded constructors for `LayerResource`, `FillLayerResource`, and other resource classes to improve initialization control.

- **Removed APIs**
  - Numerous obsolete methods and constructors were removed across resource-related classes, including `GradientFillSettings.getColor`, various `getSignature()` and `getKey()` methods.
