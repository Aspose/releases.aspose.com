#### Release Highlights

Aspose.HTML for .NET 25.3 introduces support for the CSS `transform-origin` property, improving SVG rendering precision. It also adds text overflow trimming with ellipsis for HTML tables, enhances XML entity parsing behavior, and fixes redirection path resolution. Several key bugs around infinite loops, layout issues, and rendering exceptions have also been addressed.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Text Overflow Trimming**: Table cells now support trimming overflowing content with ellipsis (`...`), aligning behavior with modern browser rendering engines.
- **Transform-Origin Support**: Implemented support for the `transform-origin` CSS property in SVG rendering for accurate graphical transformation behavior.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Relative Path Redirection Handling**: Improved URI resolution when documents are redirected from the original source URL.
- **XML Entity Processing**: Enhanced handling of XML entities to better mirror browser behaviors and security expectations.

### üõ† Fix

- **Bug Fix (HTMLNET-3047)**: Resolved infinite loop and memory consumption issues during HTML to JPG conversion.
- **Bug Fix (HTMLNET-4183)**: Fixed unit mismatch exceptions in HTML-to-PNG conversion scenarios.
- **Bug Fix (HTMLNET-2899)**: Addressed `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` in specific HTML-to-PDF edge cases.
