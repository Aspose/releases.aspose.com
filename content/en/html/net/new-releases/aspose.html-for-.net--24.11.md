#### Release Highlights

Aspose.HTML for .NET 24.11 introduces a major update focused on platform compatibility and memory efficiency. A dedicated System.Drawing-free version is now available to improve performance and stability in Linux environments. Significant fixes target SVG rendering, async PDF conversion reliability, and malformed HTML parsing.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Linux-Optimized NuGet Package**: Released a System.Drawing-independent version of Aspose.HTML for seamless cross-platform deployment.
- **Dedicated Drawing Library**: Introduced `Aspose.HTML.Drawing` as a separate NuGet package to enable more modular development and reduce system dependencies.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Font Engine Upgrades**: Internal font resolution and rendering logic improved to enhance HTML-to-PDF output fidelity, particularly with embedded or fallback fonts.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced RAM usage during conversion of large HTML files, particularly when using asynchronous processing pipelines.

### üõ† Fix

- **SVG Image Rendering**: Fixed corruption of SVG images during HTML-to-PDF conversion (regression since version 24.4).
- **Stack Overflow Exception**: Resolved error caused by malformed HTML during document load.
- **Async Conversion Stability**: Addressed infinite memory consumption and hang during async HTML-to-PDF export on specific files.
