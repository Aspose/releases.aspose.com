#### Release Highlights

The DLLs-only release of Aspose.HTML for .NET 24.12 is engineered for lightweight deployment in Linux, containerized, and serverless environments. With core rendering fixes, improved support for .NET 8, and the removal of System.Drawing dependencies, this version strengthens production readiness across platforms.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Portable API Build**: Fully decoupled from System.Drawing.Common, this version supports .NET 7/8 in Linux and Docker environments without compatibility issues.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Flexbox Engine Update**: Enhanced support for flex-based layouts, addressing wrapping, justification, and alignment discrepancies in exported documents.
- **Platform-Independent Font Rendering**: Improved rendering of superscripts, borders, and inline styles across PDF and image outputs.
- **Stability on Save**: Prevented hanging and corrupted files during PDF export from malformed HTML.

### üõ† Fix

- Corrected superscript rendering in HTML-to-PDF output (HTMLNET-5972).
- Fixed crash and rendering issues in Linux container scenarios (HTMLNET-5578, HTMLNET-4132).
- Eliminated dependency on unsupported System.Drawing for non-Windows platforms (HTMLNET-4980, HTMLNET-5594, HTMLNET-5895).
- Addressed save operation failures producing empty PDF files (HTMLNET-5935).
