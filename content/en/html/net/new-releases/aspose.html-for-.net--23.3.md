## Improved memory management

The Aspose.HTML API for .NET has been optimized to use less memory, especially when converting large or complex `HTML` documents.

## Cancel Long-running Operations

The Aspose.HTML API for .NET now supports the `CancellationToken` (Only for .Net Framework > 4.0), which allows App developers to cancel long-running operations, such as a large `HTML` document to `PDF` conversion.

## Improved `HTML` to `PNG` Conversion

Fixed a bug that could cause a `System.OutOfMemoryException` to be thrown when converting a large HTML document to PNG.
