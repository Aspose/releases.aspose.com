#### Release Highlights

Aspose.HTML for .NET 24.10 (DLLs Only) continues the evolution of a fully platform-agnostic rendering engine. The update removes reliance on System.Drawing, enhances HTML-to-image rendering through modern APIs, and provides fixes to long-standing document conversion issues.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **WebFontStyle Enum**: Replaces legacy `FontStyle` with platform-neutral rendering logic.
- **Improved Rendering Options**: Introduced `UseAntialiasing` and `UseHinting` for image precision.
- **Markdown Toolkit**: Adds support for fenced/indented code blocks, link destinations, and whitespace via `MarkdownSyntaxFactory`.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Removed Platform-Specific APIs**:
  - `TextRenderingHint` and `SmoothingMode` removed to eliminate `System.Drawing.Common` dependency.
- **Graphics Context Update**:
  - `GraphicContext.FontStyle` now uses the new `WebFontStyle` enum for better control and future extensibility.

### üõ† Fix

- Fixed exception for unit type mismatches when parsing complex HTML layouts.
- Addressed Linux-specific `NullReferenceException` in PDF conversion.
- Improved diagnostics for checkbox rendering and unreachable image links.
