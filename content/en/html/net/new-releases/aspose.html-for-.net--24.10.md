#### Release Highlights

Aspose.HTML for .NET 24.10 delivers a significant update by completely removing dependencies on `System.Drawing.Common`, ensuring smoother cross-platform behavior on Linux and macOS. It also introduces better text and image rendering APIs and resolves key PDF and HTML rendering bugs.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Unified Text Styling API**: Introduced `WebFontStyle` enum to replace platform-dependent `FontStyle`.
- **Enhanced Image Rendering**: Added `UseAntialiasing` and `UseHinting` options for image clarity control.
- **Markdown Improvements**: Introduced a `MarkdownSyntaxFactory` to simplify Markdown element creation.
- **Rendering Environment Control**: Added `IUserAgentService.ShowImagePlaceholders` to manage fallback image visibility.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Cross-Platform Readiness**: Removed deprecated properties such as `TextRenderingHint` and `SmoothingMode`, previously dependent on System.Drawing.
- **Better Developer Experience**: Simplified API for `ImageRenderingOptions` and `TextOptions` classes, making rendering logic cleaner and .NET-native.

### üõ† Fix

- Resolved `Incompatible unit types` exception during HTML load.
- Fixed `NullReferenceException` on Linux during HTML-to-PDF conversion.
