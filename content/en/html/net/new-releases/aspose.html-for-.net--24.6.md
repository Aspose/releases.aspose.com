Version 24.6 of Aspose.HTML for .NET brings several improvements to enhance your application's HTML conversion capabilities. We've refined the document encoding detection algorithm for better accuracy and HTML parsing, rendering, and font handling.

### Accurate Encoding Detection

We have improved the encoding algorithm in the latest C# HTML API release to ensure the correct interpretation of character sets in HTML documents.

### Enhanced HTML Rendering

Various functionalities such as splitting, parsing, and font handling have been optimized, which leads to a more accurate representation of your HTML content within your .NET HTML parsing apps.

### Improved Text Quality

Better processing of font naming tables in Aspose.HTML for .NET 24.6 leads to sharper and more accurate text rendering in converted documents.

### Bug Fixes

The latest library version has resolved issues with table continuation across pages, font-weight handling, markdown conversion indentation, radio button rendering in PDFs, and closing tag addition.
