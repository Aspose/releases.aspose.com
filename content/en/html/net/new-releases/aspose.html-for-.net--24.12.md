#### Release Highlights

Aspose.HTML for .NET 24.12 brings critical rendering improvements for HTML to PDF workflows, especially on Linux and .NET 8.0 platforms. With deep fixes for layout fidelity, superscript rendering, Flex elements, and border consistency, this version ensures smoother cross-platform document processing and production-grade export stability.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **.NET 7+ Compatibility without System.Drawing**: Improved runtime support for .NET 7 and .NET 8, removing hard dependencies on System.Drawing.Common to ensure smooth execution on non-Windows platforms.
- **Enhanced Linux Rendering Pipeline**: Optimized internal rendering engine to work flawlessly inside Docker and Linux containers, including for headless conversion services.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Better Flexbox Layout Support**: Improved Flex element alignment and layout accuracy during conversion to PDF and image formats.
- **Superscript Positioning**: Corrected baseline rendering for superscript elements, especially in complex text and nested containers.
- **Improved Border Fidelity**: Ensured visual consistency between HTML browser preview and resulting PDF borders.
- **System.Drawing Independence**: Fully removed deprecated System.Drawing APIs from rendering logic to boost portability and reduce crashes on Linux.

### üõ† Fix

- Resolved issue where superscript text appeared misaligned in PDF exports (HTMLNET-5972).
- Fixed multiple Linux-specific HTML-to-PDF failures (HTMLNET-5578, HTMLNET-4132).
- Eliminated 0kb corrupted output file generation in some save operations (HTMLNET-5935).
- Resolved System.PlatformNotSupportedException errors caused by System.Drawing on non-Windows platforms (HTMLNET-4980, HTMLNET-5594, HTMLNET-5895).
