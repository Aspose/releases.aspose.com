#### Release Highlights

The DLLs-only release of Aspose.HTML for .NET 24.11 focuses on modularity, memory optimization, and platform neutrality. By separating drawing logic and improving PDF conversion behavior, developers gain fine-grained control across environments.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Modular Linux-Compatible Build**: Added support for `Aspose.HTML.Drawing` NuGet package with no reliance on System.Drawing, tailored for Docker, Linux, and containerized apps.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Font System Tweaks**: Enhanced how fonts are resolved and embedded in documents, improving PDF fidelity and reducing fallback mismatches.
- **Performance Tuning**: Lowered memory overhead when using asynchronous document export, preventing thread hangs on large or malformed HTML files.

### üõ† Fix

- Fixed **SVG image corruption** during PDF export caused by recent regression (HTMLNET-5807).
- Prevented **stack overflow crash** on malformed HTML load (HTMLNET-5900).
- Solved **async infinite loop and memory spike** when processing HTML to PDF (HTMLNET-5909).
