We are excited to announce the Aspose.HTML for .NET 24.3 (MSI) release! With this update, you can enjoy improved font handling within Docker environments utilizing Debian 12 base images and more.

### Enhanced Docker Integration

The .NET HTML library now offers more dynamic font support for Docker containers built on Debian 12, facilitating consistent rendering and manipulation of HTML content.

### HTML to PNG Conversion

The exceptions and issues that occurred during specific HTML to PNG conversion scenarios have been resolved in version 24.3 of Aspose.HTML for .NET.

### ASP.NET Core Compatibility

We have fixed the problems with Aspose.HTML for .NET exhibiting unexpected behavior within ASP.NET Core Bookworm projects (previously functional in Bullseye projects). It also affected font rendering in the non-working version.
