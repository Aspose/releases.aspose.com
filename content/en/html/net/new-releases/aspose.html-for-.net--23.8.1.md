## Improved `HTMLrenderer` performance

The 23.8.1 release of the Aspose.HTML for .NET API improves the performance of the HTML renderer, making it faster to render HTML documents to PDF, XPS, and image formats. This makes it easier for C#, .NET Apps developers to create and convert HTML documents efficiently.

HTML renderers are often used by C#, .NET developers to create and convert HTML documents.

Here are some generic examples of how C#, .NET developers can use an HTML renderer:

- Generate PDF reports from HTML templates.
- Convert HTML documents to images for display in user interfaces.
- Create HTML-based email templates.
- Develop rich web applications with dynamic HTML rendering.
- Integrate HTML rendering into existing applications, such as word processors and spreadsheet programs.
