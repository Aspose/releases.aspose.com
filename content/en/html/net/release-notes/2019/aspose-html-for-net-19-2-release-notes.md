## Aspose.HTML for .NET 19.2 Release Notes

-----
As per regular monthly update process of all APIs being offered by Aspose, we are honoured to announce the February release of Aspose.HTML for .NET. In this release, we have made some internal bug fixes related to the document rendering and page splitting algorithms.

## Improvements and Changes

|**Key**|**Summary**|**Category**|

|HTMLNET-1736|An exception raises while loading an HTML file|Bug|

## Added APIs:

Added the overridden method ICSSStyleDeclaration.SetProperty to simplify the declaration object usage.

{{< highlight java >}}

 namespace Aspose.Html.Dom.Css

{

    public interface ICSSStyleDeclaration : IEnumerable<string>, ICSS2Properties

    {

        /// <summary>

        /// Used to set a property value within this declaration block.

        /// </summary>

        /// <param name="propertyName">The name of the CSS property.</param>

        /// <param name="value">The property value.</param>

        void SetProperty(string propertyName, string value);

    }

}
