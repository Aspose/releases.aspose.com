{{% /alert %}}

As per the regular monthly update process of all APIs being offered by Aspose, we are honored to announce the July release of Aspose.HTML for .NET.

In this release, we have improved the processing of the WEBP graphic format, the rendering quality in such formats as DOCX, PDF and PNG graphic formats.

We are postponing changes to our public signatures related to improving Linux support and removing the use of System.Drawing.Common until release 24.8.0.
