{{% /alert %}}

As per regular monthly update process of all APIs being offered by Aspose, we are honored to announce the May release of Aspose.HTML for .NET.
This release contains a long-awaited feature - the new rendering engine. It was designed according to the latest HTML and  [CSS](https://docs.fileformat.com/web/css/) specifications, which means that its rendering quality, speed, memory usage and precision are much better than in the previous one. Its implementation allows us not only to improve the quality of already implemented features, but also to be able to add new features from the latest HTML and  [CSS](https://docs.fileformat.com/web/css/) specifications. Here is the list of main improvements introduced in this release:

- increased the precision of element size calculation. Now BeginElement will contain the correct rectangle;
- much faster table layout algorithm, float positioning algorithm and many other algorithms;
- updated processing of many  [CSS](https://docs.fileformat.com/web/css/) properties according to the latest documentation;
- improved processing of the replaced elements, now they are correctly positioned and rendered.
- and much more!
