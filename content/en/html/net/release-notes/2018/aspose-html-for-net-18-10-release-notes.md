## Aspose.HTML for .NET 18.10 Release Notes

-----
As per regular monthly update process of all APIs being offered by Aspose, we are honored to announce October release of Aspose.HTML for .NET. The main improvement of this release is that we have created a truly parallel mechanism of processing the documents that significantly improved performance of processing documents with lots of resources. Moreover, from this moment you do not need to wait until document will be loaded, parsed and all scripts will be executed which of course is blocking the main thread of your application. You just need to subscribe to events the 'OnReadyStateChange' or 'OnLoad' and call the method 'navigate' which is not blocking the main thread. Once the document is ready, these events will be fired. Also, we represent to you a new namespace 'Aspose.Html.Dom.Mutations' that provides mechanisms to watch for changes being made to DOM tree. Apart from that, we have also made some internal bug fixes and enhancements as in the table below.

## Improvements and Changes

|**Key**|**Summary**|**Category**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|HTMLNET-1457|Text alignment issues with Arabic in table cells|Bug|
|HTMLNET-1499|HTML to XPS: Incorrect Woff signature exception|Bug|
|HTMLNET-1507|Font-size "em"-values in at-page rules cause an exception|Bug|

## Added APIs:

The document object has been extended with set of overloaded methods Navigate, that are create an asynchronous mode of loading unlike the HTMLDocument and SVGDocument constructors which are working in synchronous mode.

{{< highlight java >}}

 namespace Aspose.Html.Dom

{

    public class Document

    {

        /// <summary>

        /// Loads the document at the specified Uniform Resource Locator (URL) into the current instance, replacing the previous content.

        /// </summary>

        /// <param name="address">The document address.</param>

        public void Navigate(string address) {}

        /// <summary>

        /// Loads the document at the specified Uniform Resource Locator (URL) into the current instance, replacing the previous content.

        /// </summary>

        /// <param name="url">The document URL.</param>

        public void Navigate(Url url) {}

        /// <summary>

        /// Loads the document from specified content and using baseUri to resolve relative resources, replacing the previous content.

        /// </summary>

        /// <param name="content">The document content.</param>

        /// <param name="baseUri">The base URI to resolve relative resources.</param>

        public void Navigate(string content, string baseUri) {}

        /// <summary>

         /// Loads the document from specified content and using baseUri to resolve relative resources, replacing the previous content.

         /// </summary>

         /// <param name="content">The document content.</param>

         /// <param name="baseUri">The base URI to resolve relative resources.</param>

        public void Navigate(Stream content, string baseUri) {}

        /// <summary>

        /// Loads the document based on specified request object, replacing the previous content.

        /// </summary>

        /// <param name="request">The request object that is used to load document content.</param>

        public void Navigate(RequestMessage request) {}

    }

}

Added event OnReadyStateChange and ReadyState property in order to inform the user about document's readiness state.

{{< highlight java >}}

 namespace Aspose.Html.Dom

{

    public class Document

    {

        /// <summary>

        /// Gets or sets event handler for OnReadyStateChange event.

        /// </summary>

        public event DOMEventHandler OnReadyStateChange;

        /// <summary>

        /// Returns the document readiness. The "loading" while the Document is loading, "interactive" once it is finished parsing but still loading sub-resources, and "complete" once it has loaded.

        /// </summary>

        public string ReadyState { get; }

    }

}

Introduced the Dom.Mutations namespace that provides mechanisms to watch for changes being made to the DOM tree.

{{< highlight java >}}

 namespace Aspose.Html.Dom.Mutations

    /// <summary>

    /// Represents the method that will handle a mutation events.

The abstract renderer object was extended with overload 'render' methods in order to add ability to control rendering timeouts.

{{< highlight java >}}

 namespace Aspose.Html.Rendering

#### Changed APIs:
StyleSheets property was relocated to the base 'document' class from the HTML and SVG documents.

{{< highlight java >}}

 namespace Aspose.Html.Dom

{

    public class Document

    {

        /// <summary>

        /// A list containing all the style sheets explicitly linked into or embedded in a document. For HTML documents, this includes external style sheets, included via the HTML LINK element, and inline STYLE elements.

        /// </summary>

        public IStyleSheetList StyleSheets { get; }

    }
