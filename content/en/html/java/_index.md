## Get Started

Aspose.HTML Java APIs are hosted at the [Aspose Repository](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/). You can easily use Aspose.HTML for Java API directly in your Maven projects with simple configurations. For the detailed instructions please visit [Installing Aspose.HTML for Java from Aspose Repository](https://docs.aspose.com/html/java/installation/) documentation page.

## Load HTML from a Remote Location

```java
HTMLDocument document = HTMLDocument(new Url("template.html"));
// read children nodes and get length information
if (document.getBody().getChildNodes().getLength() == 0)
    System.out.println("No ChildNodes found...");
// print Document URI to console. As per information above, it has to be https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/
System.out.println("Print Document URI = " + document.getDocumentURI());
// print domain name for remote HTML
System.out.println("Domain Name = " + document.getDomain());
```

## How to use the Examples?

Clone or Download the ZIP and extract the contents to your local hard drive. This project uses Maven/Gradle build system and can be opened in any modern IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse or NetBeans. For more details, visit our [Documentation website](https://docs.aspose.com/display/htmljava/How+to+Run+the+Examples).

## Step one

For maven
```
mvn compile test
```
For gradle
```
gradle build
```
## Execute all tests
Maven
```
mvn -Dtest="com.aspose.html.examples.**" test
```

Gradle
```
./gradlew test --tests "com.aspose.html.examples.*"
```

## Execute single test
Maven
```
mvn -Dtest=Examples_Java_AdvancedUsage_DOMMutationObserver_ObserveHowNodesAreAdded test
```
Gradle
```
./gradlew test --tests "com.aspose.html.examples.Examples_Java_AdvancedUsage_DOMMutationObserver_ObserveHowNodesAreAdded"
```
## Execute asynchronously test in Thread
Maven
```
mvn org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:3.0.0:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.aspose.html.examples.SimpleWait" -Dexec.classpathScope="test" -Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false
```
Gradle
```
./gradlew SimpleWait
```
