You may navigate HTML documents by using various methods, such as, element traversal, document traversal, XPath queries, and CSS selector queries as well as manipulate HTML DOM via JavaScript, convert HTML file to images or fixed layout formats, and convert XHTML and EPUB files to other file formats.

## Get Started

Aspose.HTML Java APIs are hosted at the [Aspose Repository](https://releases.aspose.com/html/java/). You can easily use Aspose.HTML for Java API directly in your Maven projects with simple configurations. For the detailed instructions please visit [Installing Aspose.HTML for Java from Aspose Repository](https://docs.aspose.com/html/java/installation/) documentation page.

## Load HTML from a Remote Location

```java
HTMLDocument document = HTMLDocument(new Url("template.html"));
// read children nodes and get length information
if (document.getBody().getChildNodes().getLength() == 0)
    System.out.println("No ChildNodes found...");
// print Document URI to console. As per information above, it has to be https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/
System.out.println("Print Document URI = " + document.getDocumentURI());
// print domain name for remote HTML
System.out.println("Domain Name = " + document.getDomain());
```

## How to use the Examples?

Clone or Download the ZIP and extract the contents to your local hard drive. This project uses Maven/Gradle build system and can be opened in any modern IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse or NetBeans. For more details, visit our [Documentation website](https://docs.aspose.com/display/htmljava/How+to+Run+the+Examples).

## Step one

For maven
```
mvn compile test
```
For gradle
```
gradle build
```
## Execute all tests
Maven
```
mvn -Dtest="com.aspose.html.examples.**" test
```

Gradle
```
./gradlew test --tests "com.aspose.html.examples.*"
```

## Execute single test
Maven
```
mvn -Dtest=Examples_Java_AdvancedUsage_DOMMutationObserver_ObserveHowNodesAreAdded test
```
Gradle
```
./gradlew test --tests "com.aspose.html.examples.Examples_Java_AdvancedUsage_DOMMutationObserver_ObserveHowNodesAreAdded"
```
## Execute asynchronously test in Thread
Maven
```
mvn org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:3.0.0:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.aspose.html.examples.SimpleWait" -Dexec.classpathScope="test" -Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false
```
Gradle
```
./gradlew SimpleWait
```
