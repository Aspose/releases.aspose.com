## What's new in the Aspose.HTML for Java 24.12

#### Release Highlights

Aspose.HTML for Java 24.12 focuses on API usability and MHTML conversion stability. This release introduces `java.io.OutputStream` support across HTML, EPUB, SVG, and MHTML conversion methods, enabling more flexible stream-based document generation. Additionally, a key bug in MHTML-to-JPG conversion was resolved.

## Bug Fixes

- **HTMLJAVA-1896**  
  Fixed `An element with the same key already exists in the dictionary` during MHTML to JPG conversion.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

### ✅ New Features

- Added `OutputStream` support to all conversion methods in `com.aspose.html.converters.Converter`, including:
  - `convertHTML`, `convertEPUB`, `convertMHTML`, `convertSVG`
  - Overloads accepting `InputStream`, `String path`, `Url`, or `HTMLDocument` sources
  - Accepting all supported save options: `PdfSaveOptions`, `DocSaveOptions`, `XpsSaveOptions`, `ImageSaveOptions`
