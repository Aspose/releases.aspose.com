## Major Features ##

We are honored to announce the December release of Aspose.HTML for Java.

We have done a lot to stabilize the product. The stability has been improved processing [CSS](https://docs.fileformat.com/web/css/), SVG, Markdown, Fonts, bidi text rendering, and table. We also made stabilization when working with licenses.
