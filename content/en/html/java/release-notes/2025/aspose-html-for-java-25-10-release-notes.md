This page contains release notes for Aspose.HTML for Java 25.10

{{% /alert %}}

We are honored to announce the October release of Aspose.HTML for Java.

In this release, we fixed the update lifecycle for animatable SVG attributes (SMIL/CSS). 
Changes to baseVal/animVal now correctly flow into computed values, 
trigger geometry/layout/painting invalidation, and show up immediately in rendering. 
The update touches the SVG DOM data types layer, path segment lists.
