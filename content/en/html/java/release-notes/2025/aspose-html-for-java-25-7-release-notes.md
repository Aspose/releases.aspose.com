{{% /alert %}}

We are honored to announce the Jule release of Aspose.HTML for Java.

In this release, we resolved an issue related to support for the **modern WebP image format**.

#### What is WebP?

**WebP** is a next-generation image format developed by **Google**. It provides superior compression while maintaining high visual quality. Compared to traditional formats like JPEG and PNG, WebP achieves significantly smaller file sizes, which improves performance in web and mobile applications.

#### Key Features of WebP:

*  **Lossy and lossless compression**
*  **Transparency support** (like PNG)
*  **Animation support** (like GIF, but more efficient)
*  **Smaller file sizes** â€” typically 25â€“35% smaller than JPEG or PNG
*  **Wide browser and platform support**

WebP is widely used in modern web development to optimize image loading and reduce bandwidth usage.

#### Resources:
