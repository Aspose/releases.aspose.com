This page contains release notes for Aspose.HTML for Java 25.8

{{% /alert %}}

We are honored to announce the August release of Aspose.HTML for Java.

In this release, we have introduced several important improvements to enhance stability and accuracy:

* Improved MHTML support – Fixed an issue with the HTMLDocument.save() method to ensure correct saving in the MHTML format.
* DOM enhancements – Addressed problems in element creation and document location processing within the DOM module.
* Better cookie handling – Reviewed and improved the processing of HTTP cookies for more consistent behavior.
* Accurate layout conversion – Fixed a conversion issue that previously caused distortions in the original document layout.

These updates improve reliability, ensure greater fidelity in conversions, and provide a smoother developer experience.
