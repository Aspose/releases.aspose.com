This page contains release notes for Aspose.HTML for Java 26.1

{{% /alert %}}

As per the regular monthly being offered by Aspose,
we are honored to announce the January release of Aspose.HTML for Java.

Below is a summary of the key improvements included in this release:

- Added safety constraints (null guards) in rendering SVG image to prevent null-related issues during SVG rendering.
- Improved handling for missing SVG, missing style (width calculation), and missing/empty viewBox values by adding defensive checks and safe defaults.
- When SVG input is absent, processing now returns an empty result instead of failing.
- Fixed RegExp behavior for matching expressions and RegExp construction.
