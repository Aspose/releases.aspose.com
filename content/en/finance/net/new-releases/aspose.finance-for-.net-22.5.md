# Handle Schema from xbrl.ifrs.org

Ability to handle schema from xbrl.ifrs.org (IFRS Accounting Taxonomy).

# Support for Nested Non-Numeric Facts

The support to handle nested nonNumeric facts has been added.

# Support for Inline XBRL exclude Element

The support has been added for the `exclude` element which can be used to encapsulate data that is not to be included while processing the footnote or nonNumeric elements. This element serves the purpose of preventing text content from being included in the {value} properties of footnote or nonNumeric.
