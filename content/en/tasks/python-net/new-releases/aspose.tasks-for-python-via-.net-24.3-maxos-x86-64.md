Utilize the enhanced features and bug fixes to streamline MS Project file processing, boost development productivity, and gain finer control over calendar management within your Python applications on macOS with Aspose.Tasks for Python via .NET 24.3 update.

### Greater Calendar Control

Developers can utilize the new `Aspose.Tasks.Calendar.Guid` property to programmatically access calendar GUIDs in your Python projects on macOS.

### Enhanced MS Project Compatibility

We have improved the reading of non-standard MPP files created with MS Project 16.0 in this version of Python via .NET API, which optimizes the compatibility of your MS Project file formats across your document manipulation apps.

### Manage your Time-phased Data

This update enhances your ability to efficiently input time-phased data for material resource assignments, particularly on macOS. This results in smoother management workflows for MPP files.

### Robust Python Development

Efficiently leverage a range of bug fixes for assignment GUIDs, `PercentComplete` calculations, `ActualFinish` settings, and more.
