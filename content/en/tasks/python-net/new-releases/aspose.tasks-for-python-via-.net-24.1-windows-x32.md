Aspose.Tasks for Python via .NET 24.3 brings a wave of improvements specifically for Windows 32-bit developers working with MPP files in their Python apps.

### Key Highlights

- **Visual Consistency:** Developers can rest assured that their project's visual elements, like charts and graphs, will remain intact when opening and saving MPP files using the Python MPP files processing API.
- **Accurate External Task Management:** Whether you're working with external tasks or their unique identifiers, this update ensures precise reading and writing of your project data.
- **Clean Project Files:** Say goodbye to the extra, unexpected resource that used to appear when opening MPP9 files. Aspose.Tasks for Python via .NET 24.1 eliminates that bug, keeping your project files clean and organized.
- **Precise Cost Calculations:** Specific MPP file versions can sometimes lead to inaccurate cost variance calculations. This update resolves that issue, providing you with reliable cost data on Windows 32-bit systems.

### Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes

### Added API Members
