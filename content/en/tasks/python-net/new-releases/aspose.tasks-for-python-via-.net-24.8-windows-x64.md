Implement enriched rescheduling logic and accurate calculations of task durations into your Python project management applications using Aspose.Tasks for Python via .NET 24.8 (Windows x64). This release streamlines project handling and offers better alignment with MS Project.

### Reschedule Uncompleted Work Logic

In the latest project data manipulation Python API release, we have introduced a refined method for handling uncompleted tasks when rescheduling to better manage task progress and offer precise control for project timelines.

### MS Project Compatibility

The differences in task date handling between Aspose.Tasks and MS Project have been reduced to improve data consistency on Windows 64-bit systems.

### Bug Fixes

- Reschedule Date Inconsistencies: We have addressed date discrepancies between Aspose.Tasks and MS Project when using reschedule functionality. (TASKSNET-11173)
- Stop/Resume Property Calculation: The inaccuracies in calculating stop and resume dates for tasks have been resolved. (TASKSNET-11249)
- Summary Task Duration Fix: Corrected calculation issues for the actual duration, overall duration, and finish times of summary tasks. (TASKSNET-11252)
