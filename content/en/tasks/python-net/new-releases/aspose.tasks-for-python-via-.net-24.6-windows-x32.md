Level up your Python solutions on Windows 32-bit using the latest Aspose.Tasks for Python via .NET 24.6 release. This version delivers the new resource leveling functionality, supercharged security, and FIPS compliance.

### Introducing Resource Leveling

Better manage resource allocation and task scheduling with the newly added resource leveling feature in the Python project manipulation API and guarantee effective project execution. You can view the limitations related to the resource leveling feature by visiting the [release notes](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/python-net/release-notes/2024/aspose-tasks-for-python-net-24-6-release-notes/) page.

Here is how you can implement resource leveling functionality into your Python apps:

```python

import aspose.tasks as tsk

project = tsk.Project("input.mpp")
tsk.leveling.ResourceLeveler.level_all(project);

```

### Beefed-up Security

With the upgraded security measures, you can protect your project data and safeguard against any vulnerabilities on Windows x32.

### Ensure FIPS Compliance

Aspose.Tasks for Python via .NET 24.6 allows you to ensure compliance with federal information processing standards (FIPS) by using secure cryptographic algorithms.

### Bug Fixes

We have resolved issues with time-phased data, TIFF generation, non-FIPS-compliant algorithms, and calendar reading in this release.
