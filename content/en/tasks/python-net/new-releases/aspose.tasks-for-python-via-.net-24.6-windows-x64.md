Take your Python applications to the next level on Windows 64-bit with the latest Aspose.Tasks for Python via .NET 24.6 release. This release introduces the new resource leveling feature, beefed-up security, and FIPS compliance.

### Resource Leveling

Optimize resource allocation and task scheduling with the new resource leveling feature in this version of the Python project manipulation API and ensure efficient project execution. To view the limitations related to the resource leveling feature, please visit the [release notes](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/python-net/release-notes/2024/aspose-tasks-for-python-net-24-6-release-notes/) page.

Here is how you can implement resource leveling functionality into your Python apps:

```python

import aspose.tasks as tsk

project = tsk.Project("input.mpp")
tsk.leveling.ResourceLeveler.level_all(project);

```

### Upgraded Security

You can now benefit from improved security measures to safeguard your project data and protect against any vulnerabilities on Windows x64.

### FIPS-Compliant Algorithms

Aspose.Tasks for Python via .NET 24.6 helps you ensure compliance with federal information processing standards (FIPS) by using secure cryptographic algorithms.

### Bug Fixes

We have resolved issues with time-phased data, TIFF generation, non-FIPS-compliant algorithms, and calendar reading in this release.
