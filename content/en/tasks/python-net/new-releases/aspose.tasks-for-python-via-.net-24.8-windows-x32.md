The latest version of Aspose.Tasks for Python via .NET (v24.8) for Windows x32 offers improved task handling features and crucial bug fixes. Developers can now access refined task scheduling logic and ensure more accurate project timelines.

### Improved Rescheduling Logic

This project management Python API version introduces a method for handling uncompleted tasks while rescheduling to better manage task progress and provide accurate control for project timelines.

### Enhanced MS Project Compatibility

We have reduced the differences in task date handling between Aspose.Tasks and MS Project to empower data consistency on Windows 32-bit systems.

### Bug Fixes

- Reschedule Date Inconsistencies: We have addressed date discrepancies between Aspose.Tasks and MS Project when using reschedule functionality. (TASKSNET-11173)
- Stop/Resume Property Calculation: The inaccuracies in calculating stop and resume dates for tasks have been resolved. (TASKSNET-11249)
- Summary Task Duration Fix: Corrected calculation issues for the actual duration, overall duration, and finish times of summary tasks. (TASKSNET-11252)
