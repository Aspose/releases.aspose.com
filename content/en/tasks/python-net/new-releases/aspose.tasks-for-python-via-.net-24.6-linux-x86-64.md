Linux developers, rejoice! The latest release of Aspose.Tasks for Python via .NET (v24.6) is here, and it brings a new feature in resource leveling, along with refined security, and FIPS compliance for your Linux applications.

### New feature: Resource Leveling

Using the newly introduced resource leveling feature, you can handle resource allocation and task scheduling smoothly. With this update to the Python project manipulation API, you can ascertain efficient project execution. Please view the limitations related to the resource leveling feature by visiting the [release notes](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/python-net/release-notes/2024/aspose-tasks-for-python-net-24-6-release-notes/) page.

Here is how you can implement resource leveling functionality into your Python apps:

```python

import aspose.tasks as tsk

project = tsk.Project("input.mpp")
tsk.leveling.ResourceLeveler.level_all(project);

```
