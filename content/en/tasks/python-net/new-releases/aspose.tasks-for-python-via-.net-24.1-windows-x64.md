This release of Aspose.Tasks for Python via .NET 24.1 brings exciting enhancements for developers working with MPP files in their Python applications on Windows 64-bit architecture. 

### Key Highlights

- **Preserved Graphical Indicators:** It ensures existing graphical indicators remain intact when opening and saving MPP files using the Python apps API.
- **Accurate External Task Data:** We have addressed issues related to reading and writing `ExternalTaskId` and `ExternalTaskUid` information in this release.
- **Eliminated Extra Resource:** Developers can experience optimized API usage as we have fixed the issue causing an additional empty resource to appear when opening MPP9 files.
- **Enhanced Cost Variance Calculation:** This feature of Aspose.Tasks for Python via .NET 24.1 provides accurate `Rsc.CostVariance` calculation for specific MPP file versions.

### Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes

### Added API Members

We have added different new methods and properties in this release which are shared below:
- Aspose.Tasks.FilterCriteria.IsFieldValue
- Aspose.Tasks.FilterCriteria.SetValueField(Aspose.Tasks.Field)
