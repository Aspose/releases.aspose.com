Aspose.Tasks for Python via .NET 24.8 for macOS x64 offers developers an efficient solution to manage task progress. With new features focused on task duration accuracy and rescheduling capabilities, this version lets macOS users manage complex project workflows.

### Rescheduling Logic Boost

We have included a method for handling uncompleted tasks during rescheduling in this release of the Python project management API to provide precise control for project timelines on macOS x64.

### Advanced MS Project Compatibility

Aspose.Tasks for Python via .NET 24.8 decreases the differences in task date handling between Aspose.Tasks and MS Project for finer data consistency on Apple Mac.

### Bug Fixes

- Reschedule Date Inconsistencies: We have addressed date discrepancies between Aspose.Tasks and MS Project when using reschedule functionality. (TASKSNET-11173)
- Stop/Resume Property Calculation: The inaccuracies in calculating stop and resume dates for tasks have been resolved. (TASKSNET-11249)
- Summary Task Duration Fix: Corrected calculation issues for the actual duration, overall duration, and finish times of summary tasks. (TASKSNET-11252)
