We are glad to announce the latest release of Aspose.Tasks for Python via .NET (v24.6) for the macOS x64 platform. This version allows MacOS developers to upgrade their Python applications with resource leveling, better protection, and FIPS compliance features.

### Resource Leveling on MacOS

The newest version of the Python project management API introduces the resource leveling feature, which helps you efficiently allocate resources and schedule tasks. This update ensures smooth project execution within your Python applications. Please view the limitations related to the resource leveling feature by visiting the [release notes](https://releases.aspose.com/tasks/python-net/release-notes/2024/aspose-tasks-for-python-net-24-6-release-notes/) page.

Here is how you can implement resource leveling functionality into your Python apps:

```python

import aspose.tasks as tsk

project = tsk.Project("input.mpp")
tsk.leveling.ResourceLeveler.level_all(project);

```

### Secure Your Project Data

Leverage the enhanced security measures in the latest release and protect your project data to safeguard against any defensive vulnerabilities on macOS x64.

### FIPS Compliance Guaranteed

Aspose.Tasks for Python via .NET 24.6 offers ensured compliance with federal information processing standards (FIPS) by using secure cryptographic algorithms.

### Bug Fixes

We have resolved issues with time-phased data, TIFF generation, non-FIPS-compliant algorithms, and calendar reading in this release.
