This exciting update brings a wealth of new features and improvements to empower Python developers on Linux machines. Now you can seamlessly integrate powerful project management capabilities into your Python applications.

### Universal MPP File Support

We've enhanced handling of non-standard MPP file structures created by MS Project 16.0. This means your Python applications on Linux, can now process a wider range of project files with ease.

### Accuracy in Task & Resource Guidance

With version 24.3 of the Python MS Project API, you can ensure accurate reading of task and resource GUIDs in XML format. This helps maintain data integrity, giving you confidence in your project data.

### Optimized Time-phased Data Management

Developers can efficiently write time-phased data for material resource assignment, which enables smoother MPP file management workflows.

### Improved Efficiency

Benefit from various bug fixes addressing performance issues such as `PercentComplete` calculations, `ActualFinish` settings, and more.
