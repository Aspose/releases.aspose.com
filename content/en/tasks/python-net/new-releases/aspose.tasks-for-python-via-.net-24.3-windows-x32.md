This latest release of Aspose.Tasks for Python via .NET 24.3 brings exciting new features and improvements for Python developers working on Windows 32-bit machines. It empowers you to integrate powerful project management capabilities into your apps.

### Broader MPP File Support

We've improved handling of non-standard MPP file structures created by MS Project 16.0. This means your Python applications can now process a wider range of project files, for your Windows x32 architecture.

### Accurate Task & Resource GUIDs

This version 24.3 of the project management API ensures accurate reading of task and resource GUIDs in XML format. This helps maintain data integrity across different systems.

### Management of Time-phased

Developers can efficiently write time-phased data for assignments of material resources. This translates to smoother MPP file management workflows on Windows 32-bit systems.

### Calendar Access Improvements

The new `Aspose.Tasks.Calendar.Guid` property allows you to fetch calendar GUIDs within your Python applications.
