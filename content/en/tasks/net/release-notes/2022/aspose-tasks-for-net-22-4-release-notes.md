| Aspose.Tasks.UndefinedConstraintHandlingBehavior.SubstituteWithStartNoEarlierThan | Constraints with type 'ConstraintType.StartNoEarlierThan' and date = Start are added for tasks with 'Undefined' constraint. |
## **Examples and additional notes**

In this release we focused on improvement of Primavera XER format support.

**Related issue: TASKSNET-4602 - Extend XER import to support XER files with more than 1 projects**

The support of reading of XER files containing multiple projects was added. Also PrimaveraReadOptions class was introduced to make a unified API for both Primavera XML and Primavera XER formats reading.
PrimaveraReadOptions.ProjectUid can be used to specify ID of project to read.
You can use PrimaveraXerReader to read IDs of projects contained in .XER file:

{{< highlight csharp >}}

string xerFile = "test.xer";
PrimaveraXerReader reader = new PrimaveraXerReader(xerFile);
var projectUids = reader.GetProjectUids();
var projectId = projectUids[0];

var firstProject = new Project(xerFile,
    new PrimaveraReadOptions()
    {
        ProjectUid = projectId
    });

{{< /highlight >}}

**Related issue: TASKSNET-10500 - Add a way to specify behavior of task constraints import for XER format**

PrimaveraReadOptions.UndefinedConstraintHandlingBehavior was added to make it possible to specify behavior used to handle tasks with Undefined contraint when reading project.
Prior to 22.4 the default behavior was to add "StartNoEarlier" constraint with "Start" date for these tasks. Now the default behavior is "None" (no constraints are added).

{{< highlight csharp >}}

var firstProject = new Project("test.xer",
    new PrimaveraReadOptions()
    {
        ProjectUid = 1,
        UndefinedConstraintHandlingBehavior = UndefinedConstraintHandlingBehavior.SubstituteWithStartNoEarlierThan
    });
