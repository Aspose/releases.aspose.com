#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Tasks for .NET 24.9 focuses on enhancing Gantt chart rendering, improving resource assignment calculations, and extending exception tracing for better debugging.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Enhanced Bar Shapes**: Added support for `RectangleBottom`, `LineMiddle`, and `LineTop` shapes in Gantt task bars.
- **Exception Insight**: Introduced `TaskUid` property in `TaskValidationException` for better traceability.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Bar Customization**: New `StartShapeType`, `EndShapeType`, `From`, and `To` properties for defining Gantt bar styles.
- **New Shapes Support**: Added `HalfHeightBottom`, `LineTop`, and `Circle` shapes to `BarShape` enumeration.

### üõ† Fix

- Corrected indents mistakenly included in task names during Gantt chart rendering.
- Fixed incorrect calculation of peak units for resource assignments.
- Resolved inaccurate computation of `ActualDuration` and `Duration` for non-flat work contours.
- Addressed timephased data misreading in calendars with intersecting exceptions.
- Improved baseline bars rendering and Gantt bar visual accuracy.
