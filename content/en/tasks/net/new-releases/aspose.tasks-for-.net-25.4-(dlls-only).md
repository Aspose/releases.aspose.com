#### Release Highlights

The DLLs-only release of Aspose.Tasks for .NET 25.4 gives developers granular control over Gantt rendering, precise calendar calculations, and better multi-platform export fidelity for project files.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- *(No new features in this release)*

### üîß Enhancement

- **Legend API for Gantt Charts**: Introduced `PageLegendItem` for custom control over which bar types appear in exported Gantt chart legends.
- **Work Schedule Calculation**: Use `ICalendar` interface and `Calendar.GetIntersectionCalendar` to derive working hours/dates when resource and task calendars differ.
- **Timescale Alignment Modes**: `TimescaleFitBehavior` enum defines how to render the timeline up to the end of the page or defined project end.

### üõ† Fix

- Fixed invalid Primavera P6 XML structure and incorrect resource assignment export in XER/P6 files.
- Corrected overlapping and cut-off visuals in `TaskUsage` view, including `RenderToSinglePage` mode.
- Addressed timescale label misplacement near page boundaries.
- Improved task scheduling order when combining auto and manual task types.
