Effortlessly manage project tasks and resources with the latest Aspose.Tasks for .NET 24.1 (MSI). This release delivers graphical indicator preservation, improved MPP file handling, and bug fixes for a seamless development experience on Windows.

### Key Highlights

- **Accurate Visualizations:** Existing graphical indicators are now maintained when opening and saving MPP files, ensuring consistent project visuals with the C# task management API.
- **Enhanced MPP Compatibility:** We have improved the reading and writing of `ExternalTaskId` and `ExternalTaskUid` in this release for robust project data management.
- **Streamlined Resource Management:** Aspose.Tasks for .NET 24.1 includes a fix to resolve an issue causing an extra empty resource to appear when opening MPP9 files.

### Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes

### Added API Members

We have added different new methods and properties in this release which are shared below:
- Aspose.Tasks.FilterCriteria.IsFieldValue
- Aspose.Tasks.FilterCriteria.SetValueField(Aspose.Tasks.Field)
