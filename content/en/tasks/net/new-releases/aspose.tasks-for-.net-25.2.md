#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Tasks for .NET 25.2 focuses on resolving several critical bugs in baseline cost calculation, assignment work accuracy, and timephased data rendering when opening MPP files in MS Project.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- *(No new features in this release)*

### üîß Enhancement

- *(No enhancements in this release)*

### üõ† Fix

- **Assignment Baseline Work**: Corrected miscalculation of `BaselineWork` after setting the project baseline.
- **Timephased Data Start/Finish**: Fixed inconsistencies in start/finish dates of timephased segments.
- **Zero Cost Visibility**: Ensured zero baseline cost timephased data is properly visible in MS Project.
- **Start Time Accuracy**: Task `Start` now aligns with `Project.DefaultStartTime` when time is unspecified.
- **Pre-Hours Assignment Bug**: Fixed generation of timephased data when assignment starts before working hours.
- **Cost Data Rendering**: Corrected how cost-related timephased data appears in MPP when opened by MS Project.
- **Baseline Cost Correction**: Accurate baseline cost timephased data is now computed and rendered.
