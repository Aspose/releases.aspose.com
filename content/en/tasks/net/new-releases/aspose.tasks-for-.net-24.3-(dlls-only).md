Aspose.Tasks for .NET 24.3 empowers you with improved project management capabilities through downloadable DLLs. This release offers bug fixes and a new public API, allowing for seamless integration into your existing .NET development environment.

### Key Improvements

- **Improved MS Project 16.0 Support:** Aspose.Tasks for .NET 24.3 offers better compatibility with MPP files created in Microsoft Project 16.0. This means smoother opening and working with these files directly through your application's code.
- **Accurate Task & Resource Data (XML):** This update ensures precise handling of task and resource GUIDs (unique identifiers) within XML files. This eliminates potential data inconsistencies when working with project data in this format.
- **Enhanced Material Resource Management:** Aspose.Tasks now handles time-phased data for material resources more efficiently. This allows for better planning and allocation of materials throughout your project.
- **Consistent Assignment IDs Across Formats:** Assignment GUIDs (unique identifiers for task assignments) are now maintained consistently when saving projects between MPP and XML formats using the Aspose.Tasks for .NET 24.3 DLLs.
- **Accurate Calculations for Completed Tasks:** Calculations of dependent properties, which determine how completing one task affects others, are now more accurate, especially for tasks marked as 100% complete.
- **Greater Control over Zero-Duration Tasks:** With this update, you can set "Actual Finish" dates even for tasks with zero duration. This provides a more complete picture of your project schedule.

### Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes

### New Public API
- We have introduced `Aspose.Tasks.Calendar.Guid` in this release of the project management API.
