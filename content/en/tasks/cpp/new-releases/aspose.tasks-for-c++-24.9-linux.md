#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Tasks for C++ 24.9 (Linux) enhances cross-platform project scheduling and visualization. With precise Gantt chart rendering and task processing improvements, Linux users can expect improved accuracy and stability in enterprise C++ applications.

#### New Features and Enhancements

- **New Gantt Bar Shapes on Linux**:  
  Adds support for `RectangleBottom`, `LineMiddle`, and `LineTop` bar types, offering more flexibility in timeline rendering for Linux-based project tracking tools.

- **API-Level Exception Clarity**:  
  `TaskValidationException` now includes `TaskUid` for pinpointing problematic tasks in Linux-hosted apps and scripts.

#### Fixes

- Strips unwanted indentations from bar labels.
- Corrects assignment metrics (e.g., `PeakUnits`, `Duration`) under non-flat work contour conditions.
- Reliable timephased data processing with overlapping working/calendars.
- Fixes to baseline bars and visual bar rendering in Gantt views.

#### Public API Additions

- `BarStyle`: `StartShapeType`, `EndShapeType`, `From`, `To`.
- `BarShape`: `HalfHeightBottom`, `LineTop`.
- `Shape`: `Circle`.
