This update of Aspose.Tasks for C++ empowers developers with a range of improvements for streamlined project management within their C++ applications on Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms.

### Key Highlights

- **Enhanced MPP File Handling:** Aspose.Tasks for C++ 24.3 tackles non-standard MPP file structures created by MS Project 16 to ensure seamless data processing.
- **Robust Task & Resource Management:** Developers can experience improved handling of tasks and resource Guids within XML formats and strengthen data integrity using the C++ project management API.
- **Accurate Timephased Data Management:** Precise handling of timephased data for material resource assignments enhances project planning accuracy.
- **Optimized Project Saving:** You can effectively maintain data consistency as repetitive saving to MPP and XML formats no longer results in empty assignment Guids.

### Additional Updates

- Accuracy of calculation of dependent properties for tasks with 100% completion is optimized.
- Setting `ActualFinish` for tasks with zero duration is supported.
