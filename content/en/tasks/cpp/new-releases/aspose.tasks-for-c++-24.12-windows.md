  Improved TIFF rendering setup for .NET 6 on Windows systems.

#### Fixes

- Corrected misalignment of timescale labels on multi-page spans.
- Prevented an extra empty column insertion during XLSX export.
- Gantt bars now maintain correct position and gridline styling.
- Fixed formula evaluation involving `Baseline2 Start/Finish` fields.
- Resolved issues with missing timescale labels at unaligned start points.

#### Public API Changes

- **New Property**:  
  - `TimescaleTier::get_RenderLabelOnEachPage()` / `set_RenderLabelOnEachPage(bool)`
