#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Tasks for C++ 24.11 (Windows) brings advanced project manipulation to native C++ apps with support for removing VBA macros from MPP files, writing group definitions, and improved font and task formatting behavior in Microsoft Project formats.

#### New Features

- **VBA Macro Removal**:  
  Use `MPPSaveOptions::set_ClearVba(true)` to remove VBA project macros while saving to MPP.

- **Group Definitions Writing**:  
  Write task and resource groups to MPP files with full control over criteria, formatting, and group behaviors.

#### Enhancements

- Added `GroupAssignments` property to allow grouping by assignments instead of tasks.
- MPP export now supports `WriteGroups` to ensure new groups are written explicitly.

#### Fixes

- Corrected reading of `GroupOn` and `GroupInterval` in certain group criteria.
- Fixed export of `TimephasedData` for baseline summary tasks.
- Resolved font size issues in overridden `TextStyles`.
- Addressed task rollup behavior for MSP 2010 format.
- Fixed task progress visibility when viewed in Microsoft Project.
- Resolved missing font saving when custom styles or groups use previously unused fonts.
- Prevented exceptions on duplicate key conflicts when loading specific MPP files.

#### Public API Additions

- **Class: `Aspose::Tasks::Group`**
  - `get_GroupAssignments()` / `set_GroupAssignments(bool)`

- **Class: `Aspose::Tasks::Saving::MPPSaveOptions`**
  - `get_WriteGroups()` / `set_WriteGroups(bool)`
  - `get_ClearVba()` / `set_ClearVba(bool)`
