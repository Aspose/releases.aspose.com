#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Tasks for C++ 24.9 (Windows) delivers enhanced Gantt chart rendering with newly supported bar shapes, accurate resource assignment calculations, and enriched API access for .NET-style project task management on Windows using C++.

#### New Features and Enhancements

- **New Gantt Bar Styles for Windows**:  
  Support added for `RectangleBottom`, `LineMiddle`, and `LineTop` shapes in Gantt chart rendering, ideal for desktop and server-side Windows project applications.

- **Improved Task Exception Handling**:  
  `TaskValidationException` now exposes `TaskUid` to help Windows developers trace and debug task-related issues quickly.

#### Fixes

- Task name indent artifacts removed from Gantt chart text rendering.
- Corrected `PeakUnits` and `ActualDuration` calculations in complex resource scenarios.
- Timephased data correctly handled when overlapping calendar/working exceptions are present.
- Accurate baseline bar visuals.
- General stability and rendering improvements in Gantt chart outputs.

#### Public API Additions

- New `BarStyle` properties: `StartShapeType`, `EndShapeType`, `From`, and `To`.
- New `BarShape` enums: `HalfHeightBottom`, `LineTop`.
- New `Shape` enum: `Circle`.
