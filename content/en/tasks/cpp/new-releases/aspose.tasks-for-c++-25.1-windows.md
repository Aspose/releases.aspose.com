#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Tasks for C++ 25.1 (Windows) introduces the ability to programmatically define resource tables and resolves several issues with assignment calculations and baseline rendering, ensuring better compatibility with Microsoft Project.

#### Enhancement

- **Resource Tables Creation**:  
  Developers can now define and manage tables specific to project resources, expanding custom reporting and layout capabilities.

#### Fixes

- **Incorrect Stop/Resume on ActualWork**:  
  Fixed assignment timing when zero-work segments end ActualWork timephased data.

- **ActualStart/Finish Reading**:  
  Corrected extraction of `Asn.ActualStart` and `Asn.ActualFinish` from MPP format.

- **Finish Date Recalculation**:  
  Prevented task finish date from reverting to NA when recalculated in MS Project after saving with Aspose.Tasks.

- **Baseline Timephased Display**:  
  Restored accurate rendering of baseline timephased values in Gantt views.
