Aspose.Tasks for C++ 24.3 brings a set of enhancements specifically tailored for your development environment. Augment your C++ project management apps with our API and integrate full-featured solutions on the Windows platform.

### Key Highlights

- **Improved Handling of Non-Standard MPP Files:** Aspose.Tasks for C++ 24.3 tackles quirky MPP file structures created by MS Project 16 on Windows, ensuring seamless data processing within your C++ applications.
- **Strengthened Task & Resource Management:** This update enhances how C++ developers can manage tasks and resource Guids within XML formats on Windows. Experience improved data integrity and avoid potential issues with project data.
- **Time-Phased Data for Material Resources:** The C++ API supports precise handling of time-phased data for material resource assignments. This translates to more accurate project planning and resource allocation.
- **Consistent Data Across Saves:** Save your projects with confidence! Repetitive saving to MPP and XML formats on Windows no longer results in empty assignment GUIDs, effectively maintaining data consistency within your C++ projects.

### Additional Updates

- Calculations of dependent properties, which determine how completing one task affects others, are now even more accurate, especially for tasks marked as 100% complete.
- You can now set `ActualFinish` dates even for tasks with zero duration on Windows, providing a more comprehensive picture of your project schedule.
