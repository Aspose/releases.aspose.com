Aspose.Tasks for C++ 24.7 brings powerful project management capabilities to the Linux platform. This release delivers improvements in XER file processing, Primavera data integration, and overall API stability.

### Supercharged XER File Import

The latest release of C++ project management API makes importing projects from XER files easier than ever. You can now manage various default projects and complex calendar structures conveniently. 

### Quality Interactions with Primavera Projects

Obtain essential project information, such as name, UID, and export flag in your Linux-powered C++ applications with the newly added `PrimaveraProjectInfo` class. 

### Handle Errors Easily

Aspose.Tasks for C++ 24.7 allows you to experience refined stability with error-free MPP9 file saving, time-phased data generation, resource leveling, and resource rates.

### Optimized Data Generation

Analyze project data effortlessly by generating the correct `AssignmentActualWork` time-phased data within your C++ project file processing apps on Linux.

### Streamlined Calendar Management

Enjoy a boost to calendar reading from XER format as we have addressed the related issues. Developers can now read `MinutesPerDay`, `MinutesPerWeek`, and `DaysPerMonth` in XER format from non-default calendars.
