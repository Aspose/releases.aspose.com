#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Tasks for C++ 24.9 (macOS) empowers developers building project tools on macOS with improved timeline rendering, reliable task metrics, and an enhanced public API. It's a comprehensive scheduling toolkit for modern C++ workflows on Apple platforms.

#### New Features and Enhancements

  New bar styles including `RectangleBottom`, `LineMiddle`, and `LineTop` now render accurately on macOS visuals for precise project timelines.

- **Task Error Contextualization**:  
  `TaskValidationException` includes `TaskUid`, aiding in debugging resource or schedule issues on macOS-based builds.

#### Fixes

- Proper handling of Gantt chart text and indenting.
- Resource assignment calculations (`ActualDuration`, `Work`) corrected for advanced scenarios.
- Timephased data aligned for overlapping calendar exceptions.
- Fixes to baseline visualization and general Gantt layout on macOS.

#### Public API Additions

- `BarStyle` class: `StartShapeType`, `EndShapeType`, `From`, `To`.
