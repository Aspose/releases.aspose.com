Build powerful cross-platform project management applications with the latest Aspose.Tasks for C++ 24.8 release. It brings refined task scheduling logic and improved project data calculations to ensure more precise control over work rescheduling, task properties, and more.

### Reschedule Uncompleted Work Logic Update

In the most recent C++ task management API release, we have enhanced logic for handling uncompleted work when `Project.SplitsInProgressTasks` is false, to provide more precise scheduling and control.

### MS Project Compatibility Fixes

Differen inconsistencies between Aspose.Tasks and MS Project when using `RescheduleUncompletedWorkToStartAfter` have been addressed in Aspose.Tasks for C++ 24.8.

### Enriched Task Calculations

You can work with optimized calculations for Stop/Resume properties, `ActualDuration`, `Duration`, and `Finish` times for summary tasks across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### Fixed Bugs
- Resolved issues with the calculation of Stop/Resume properties for tasks. (TASKSNET-11249)
- Fixed inaccuracies in `ActualDuration`, `Duration`, and `Finish` for summary tasks. (TASKSNET-11252)
