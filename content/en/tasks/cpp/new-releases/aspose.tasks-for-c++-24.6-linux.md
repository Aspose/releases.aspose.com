Boost your C++ development workflows with resource leveling and supercharged security using Aspose.Tasks for C++ 24.6 release for Linux. This version enables better stability and data protection in your C++ applications running on Linux systems.

### Add Resource Leveling to Linux Apps

The C++ MPP processing library now boasts an experimental resource leveling functionality. This feature offers refined  project schedules by automatically handling task start and end dates to resolve resource conflicts. At present, this functionality has certain limitations. The following code example highlights the simple manner in which you can implement resource leveling into your C++ apps on Linux.

```c++

  auto project = System::MakeObject<Project>(System::String(u"input.mpp"));
  ResourceLeveler::LevelAll(project);

```

### Empowered Security

Aspose.Tasks for C++ 24.6 takes care of the use of non-FIPS compliant algorithms to help promote more dynamic security measures within your Linux-based C++ applications.

### Bug Fixes

This release resolves several identified problems, including:

- Issues with referencing specific versions of the System.Drawing.Common (TASKSNET-11198).
- Calendar reading errors in specific files (TASKSNET-11161).
- Incorrect time-phased data handling for assignments with contoured work contours (TASKSNET-11208).
- Exceptions encountered while reading Global MPT template files (TASKSNET-11160).
- Multipage TIFF generation problems in .NET 6.0 targeting versions (TASKSNET-11193).
