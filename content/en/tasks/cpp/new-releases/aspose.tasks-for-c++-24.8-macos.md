Great news for macOS developers! Aspose.Tasks for C++ 24.8 has been released for macOS, and it delivers key updates for task management and scheduling logic to guarantee accurate task timelines and compatibility with MS Project.

### Improved Scheduling Logic

Enhanced uncompleted work rescheduling when task splits are not allowed in the task management API, offering better project control on macOS.

### Refined Task Calculations

We have adjusted task property calculations for Stop/Resume, `ActualDuration`, and `Finish` dates to improve accuracy within your C++ applications.

### MS Project Compatibility

With Aspose.Tasks for C++ 24.8, you can ascertain macOS project management is aligned with MS Project timelines and data.

### Fixed Issues

- Fixed date differences between Aspose.Tasks and MS Project. (TASKSNET-11173)
- Corrected task Stop/Resume calculations. (TASKSNET-11249)
- Addressed inaccuracies in summary task duration and finish times. (TASKSNET-11252)
