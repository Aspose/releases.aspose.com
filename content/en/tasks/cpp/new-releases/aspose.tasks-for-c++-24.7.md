Aspose.Tasks for C++ 24.7 equips software developers to handle project data with robust C++ APIs across platforms. This release includes significant enhancements for XER file processing, Primavera project interaction, and overall API usability.

### Optimized XER File Import

Accurately import projects from XER files using the latest C++ project management API release. Handle multiple default projects and complex calendar structures efficiently on Windows and Linux platforms. 

### Enhanced Primavera Project Interaction

Retrieve essential project details like name, UID, and export flag within your C++ applications using the new `PrimaveraProjectInfo` class. 

### Robust Error Handling

Using Aspose.Tasks for C++ 24.7 release, you can experience better stability with issue-free MPP9 file saving, resource leveling, time-phased data generation, and resource rates.

### Accurate Data Generation

Generate the correct `AssignmentActualWork` time-phased data for precise project analysis in your cross-platform C++ project file processing applications.

### Improved Calendar Management

The calendar reading from XER format functionality has been upgraded by resolving the relevant problems. You can now read `MinutesPerDay`, `MinutesPerWeek`, and `DaysPerMonth` from non-default calendars in XER format.
