Designed for Windows developers, Aspose.Tasks for C++ 24.7 offers a robust API for efficient project management on Windows. This release focuses on enhancing XER file handling, Primavera data access, and overall API performance.

### Enhanced XER File Import

Easily import projects from XER files with the latest release of C++ project management API. Work with several default projects and complex calendar structures effectively. 

### Optimized Primavera Project Interactions

Fetch important project details like name, UID, and export flag in your Windows-powered C++ applications using the newly added `PrimaveraProjectInfo` class. 

### Dynamic Error Handling

Aspose.Tasks for C++ 24.7 lets you experience improved stability with problem-free MPP9 file saving, time-phased data generation, resource leveling, and resource rates.

### Data Generation Accuracy

Perform accurate project analysis by generating the correct `AssignmentActualWork` time-phased data within your C++ project file processing applications on Windows OS.

### Calendar Management Boost

We have supercharged the calendar reading from XER format functionality by fixing the relevant issues. Users can now read `MinutesPerDay`, `MinutesPerWeek`, and `DaysPerMonth` in XER format from non-default calendars.
