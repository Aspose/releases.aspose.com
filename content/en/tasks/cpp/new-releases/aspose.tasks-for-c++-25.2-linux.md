#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Tasks for C++ 25.2 (Linux) resolves multiple inconsistencies in baseline and cost timephased data for MPP files, helping project planners on Linux platforms maintain accurate financial and resource records.

#### Fixes

- Assignment baseline work now updates correctly when setting the overall project baseline.
- Timephased data start/finish dates corrected across affected cases.
- Zero baseline cost entries now visible when opened in Microsoft Project.
- Task start times now align with the default project start time if no time portion is given.
- Corrected logic for assignments beginning outside normal working hours.
- Fixed display and rendering of cost timephased information in MS Project.
- Improved calculation logic for baseline cost timephased breakdowns.
