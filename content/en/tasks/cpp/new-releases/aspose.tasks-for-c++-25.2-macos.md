#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Tasks for C++ 25.2 (macOS) improves handling of project schedule and cost breakdowns by addressing issues in MPP file timephased data generation, baseline visibility, and task start times.

#### Fixes

- Baseline work recalculates accurately after baseline application.
- Fixed timephased start and finish values rendering incorrectly.
- Visibility of baseline cost values with zero data is restored in MS Project.
- Start date now respects project-wide default start time when time is omitted.
- Assignments starting early now generate valid timephased records.
- Baseline cost distribution is now correctly calculated and rendered.
