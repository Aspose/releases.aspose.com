# What's new in the Aspose.Tasks for Java 25.3

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Tasks for Java 25.3 introduces advanced enhancements for Primavera P6 data import and Microsoft Project calculations. This release enables the reading of over 10 activity codes, supports the computation of negative slack values, and refines timephased data accuracy.

## New Features

- **Expanded Activity Code Support from P6 Files:**  
  Added support to read more than 10 activity codes from Primavera XML or XER files, expanding compatibility with complex project structures.

- **Negative Slack Calculation:**  
  Enabled the calculation of negative values for Start, Finish, and Total slacks, improving analysis of scheduling flexibility.

- **Write Actual Work Timephased Data Exceptions to MPP:**  
  Aspose.Tasks can now save implicit assignment actual work timephased data exceptions directly into MPP files.

## Bug Fixes

- **Baseline Work Missing for Material Resources:**  
  Corrected an issue where material resources were not included in the baseline work after manual baseline setting.

- **Incorrect Task.Resume and Task.Stop Values:**  
  Fixed inconsistencies in calculating task resume and stop properties during schedule changes.

- **Remaining Work Timephased Data Errors After Calendar Updates:**  
  Timephased data is now generated accurately even after modifying the resource’s base calendar.

- **Duplicate Key Exception When Adding Task Link:**  
  Resolved a bug that caused a key duplication error when linking tasks under specific conditions.

- **Timephased Data Corruption After Resource Calendar Change:**  
  Fixed a regression where actual timephased data was overwritten incorrectly after a calendar update.

- **Exception When Outdenting a Task:**  
  Addressed a scenario where task outdenting caused an unhandled exception.
