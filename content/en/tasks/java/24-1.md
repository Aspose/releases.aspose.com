# What's new in Aspose.Tasks for Java 24.1

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Tasks for Java 24.1 enhances support for Microsoft Project MPP formats by introducing new capabilities to write task and resource filters in MPP14+ and improves fidelity of graphical indicators and external task data. These updates ensure better compatibility and project data accuracy when opening files in MS Project.

## New Features

- **Preservation of Graphical Indicators:**  
  Existing graphical indicators in MPP files are now preserved accurately during read and write operations.

## Bug Fixes

- **Correct ExternalTaskId and ExternalTaskUid Handling:**  
  Resolved issues in reading and writing `ExternalTaskId` and `ExternalTaskUid` to maintain integrity of cross-project dependencies.
- **Removed Extra Empty Resource in MPP9:**  
  Fixed a bug where an unnecessary empty resource appeared when opening older MPP files.
- **Correct Rsc.CostVariance Calculations:**  
  Fixed incorrect cost variance calculations for specific MPP versions, ensuring reliable project costing data.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

### Added APIs:

- `FilterCriteria.isValueAField()`  
  Indicates if the right-hand side of the criteria is a field reference.
- `FilterCriteria.setValueByField(int)`  
  Assigns a field reference to be compared with another field value specified by `FieldName`.
