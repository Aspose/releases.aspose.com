# What's new in Aspose.Tasks for Java 24.8

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Tasks for Java 24.8 introduces enhanced logic for rescheduling uncompleted work, particularly when `Project.SplitsInProgressTasks` is set to false. This update improves alignment with Microsoft Project behavior and resolves critical bugs related to date calculations, stop/resume logic, and summary task duration metrics.

## New Features

- **Improved RescheduleUncompletedWork Logic**  
  Implemented proper handling of `RescheduleUncompletedWorkToStartAfter` method when `SplitsInProgressTasks` is set to false, ensuring accurate task scheduling without unintended splits.

## Bug Fixes

- **Date Discrepancy Fixes Post-Rescheduling**  
  Resolved inconsistencies in task date calculations between Aspose.Tasks and MS Project after invoking `RescheduleUncompletedWorkToStartAfter`.

- **Stop and Resume Property Calculation Fix**  
  Addressed issues in computing `Stop` and `Resume` task fields, which previously could yield incorrect scheduling behaviors.

- **Corrected Summary Task Duration Metrics**  
  Fixed calculation errors in `ActualDuration`, `Duration`, and `Finish` for summary tasks, improving overall schedule reliability.
