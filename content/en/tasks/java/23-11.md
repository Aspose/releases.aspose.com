## What's new in the Aspose.Tasks for Java 23.11

#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Tasks for Java 23.11 enhances project task analysis by adding a read-only `Task.getStatus()` property and enables fine-grained timephased work calculations through `ResourceAssignment.getTimephasedWork()`. It also improves CSV export behavior and MPP calendar GUID persistence.

### ✳️ New Features

- **Task Status Property**
  - A new read-only `Task.getStatus()` property is introduced to determine task progress status directly.

- **Timephased Work Calculation**
  - `ResourceAssignment.getTimephasedWork(startDate, endDate, unit)` lets you retrieve work metrics over custom intervals.

- **CSV Export Defaults**
  - `CsvOptions.View` is now automatically initialized with the default project view, simplifying CSV exports.

- **MPP Calendar GUID Writing**
  - Calendar GUIDs are now preserved when exporting to MPP, improving compatibility with external systems.

### 🛠 Fixes and Enhancements

- **NullPointerException in MPP to PDF Conversion**
  - Fixed an error that occurred during conversion of specific MPP files to PDF.

- **Internal Cleanup**
  - Deprecated `com.aspose.tasks.StringAlignment` removed in favor of `HorizontalStringAlignment`.
  - All internal `com.aspose.tasks.private_.Collections.*` classes have been removed.

### 🔄 Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Added Methods**
  - `ResourceAssignment.getTimephasedWork(Date start, Date end, byte unit)`
  - `Task.getStatus()`

- **Deleted Types**
  - `com.aspose.tasks.StringAlignment` (use `HorizontalStringAlignment` instead)
  - Classes from `com.aspose.tasks.private_.Collections.*`
