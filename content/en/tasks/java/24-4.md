## Read Project Data from Microsoft Project Database

```java
String url = "jdbc:sqlserver://";
String serverName = "192.168.56.2\\MSSQLSERVER";
String portNumber = "1433";
String databaseName = "ProjectServer_Published";
String userName = "sa";
String password = "***";
MspDbSettings settings = new MspDbSettings(url+serverName+":"+portNumber+";databaseName="+databaseName+
         ";user=" + userName + ";password=" + password, UUID.fromString("E6426C44-D6CB-4B9C-AF16-48910ACE0F54"));

addJDBCDriver(new File("sqljdbc4.jar"));

Project project = new Project(settings);
project.save(dir + "output.xml", SaveFileFormat.XML);
```
