# What's new in Aspose.Tasks for Java 24.4

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Tasks for Java 24.4 brings significant improvements in export flexibility and accuracy for Microsoft Project files. This version introduces enhanced legend rendering controls, refined material resource unit handling, and optimized CSV export capabilities.

## New Features

- **Advanced Legend Rendering Options:**  
  Introduced the `LegendDrawingOptions` enumeration to specify how the legend is rendered (on every page, after last page, not rendered, or as defined in view settings).

- **Improved Export to CSV Format:**  
  Enhanced usability for exporting to CSV format by enabling field title management through the new `FieldHelper.getDefaultFieldTitle()` method.

## Enhancements

- **Material Resource Assignment Support:**  
  Introduced `setMaterialResourceUnits(double, int)` method for assigning variable material consumption rates in MPP files.

- **Precision Improvement in Assignment Units:**  
  Removed rounding when reading `ResourceAssignment.Units` from MPP files, improving numerical accuracy.

## Bug Fixes

- **Correct Rendering of Material Assignments:**  
  Fixed issue where material assignments appeared incorrectly in MS Project when `WorkFormat` was set to `TimeUnitType.Day`.

- **Legend Display Bug:**  
  Fixed issue where the `Legend.LegendOn` setting was not applied during project rendering.

- **Zero Duration Tasks:**  
  Fixed incorrect writing of zero duration tasks that led to inaccurate dates in MS Project after recalculation.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

### Added Types:

- `LegendDrawingOptions`  
  Enum defining legend rendering behavior: `NoLegend`, `AfterLastPage`, `OnEveryPage`, `DefinedInView`.

- `UnexpectedFileFormatException`  
  Exception thrown when file format structure is unexpected.

### Added Methods:

- `ResourceAssignment.setMaterialResourceUnits(double, int)`  
  Sets units for material resource assignments with a variable consumption rate.

- `SaveOptions.getLegendDrawingOptions()`  
  Gets how legend should be rendered.

- `SaveOptions.setLegendDrawingOptions(int)`  
  Sets how legend should be rendered.

- `FieldHelper.getDefaultFieldTitle(int)`  
  Returns the default title of a specific field.

### Removed Methods:
