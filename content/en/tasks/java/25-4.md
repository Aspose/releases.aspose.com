# What's new in the Aspose.Tasks for Java 25.4

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Tasks for Java 25.4 enhances Gantt chart customization and introduces advanced calendar calculation capabilities. This release empowers developers with precise control over legend bar display and timescale behavior in visual exports, while significantly improving Primavera P6 compatibility.

## New Features

- **Legend Bar Control for Gantt Charts:**  
  Developers can now define specific bar types shown in the Gantt chart legend using the `SaveOptions.setLegendItems()` method, allowing for tailored presentation in exported PDFs and images.

- **Enhanced Timescale Alignment Settings:**  
  Introduced the `TimescaleFitBehavior` enumeration to control how the timescale aligns with the end of a page. This improves visual consistency in Gantt chart rendering.

- **Calendar Intersection for Advanced Date Calculations:**  
  A powerful API to compute intersections of task and resource calendars has been added. Users can now calculate durations, working times, and work schedule intersections with greater precision.

## Bug Fixes

- **Primavera Export Compatibility:**  
  Addressed issues where exported Primavera P6 XML files were not importing correctly, and resource assignments for summary tasks were improperly handled.

- **Gantt and TaskUsage View Rendering Fixes:**  
  Corrected layout issues with the TaskUsage view, rendering near page edges, and improved rendering under single-page export conditions.

- **Auto and Manual Task Scheduling Conflict Resolved:**  
  Resolved a bug causing incorrect scheduling when an automatic task followed a manual task, ensuring consistency in scheduling behavior.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

### Added Types

- `ICalendar` — Interface for performing calendar-based calculations.

- `ICalendar.getFinishDateByStartAndWork(Date, Duration)`
- `SaveOptions.getLegendItems() / setLegendItems(PageLegendItem[])`
- `SaveOptions.getTimescaleFitBehavior() / setTimescaleFitBehavior(TimescaleFitBehavior)`
- `LevelingOptions.setCancellationToken(CancellationToken)`
- `LoadOptions.setCancellationToken(CancellationToken)`
- `PrimaveraSaveOptions.setSkipSummaryAssignments(boolean)`
- `PrimaveraXmlSaveOptions.setSkipSummaryAssignments(boolean)`

### Added Enumerations

- `TimescaleFitBehavior` — Defines rendering behavior of the timescale’s right end.
