## Release Highlights

Aspose.Tasks for Java 24.7 focuses on improving Primavera XER file compatibility and introduces the ability to access project names and metadata through `PrimaveraBaseReader`.

  Fixed a compatibility issue causing exceptions when saving MPP9 format files after performing resource leveling.

  Eliminated an error caused by duplicate entries when reading resource rates from XER files.
