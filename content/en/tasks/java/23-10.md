## What's new in the Aspose.Tasks for Java 23.10

#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Tasks for Java 23.10 introduces baseline project support for Primavera XML files, flexible encoding options for XER import, and a refined SaveOptions hierarchy. This release also improves data integrity and cost tracking by enforcing project calendar validation and enabling access to detailed budgeted cost metrics in Primavera.

### ✳️ New Features

- **Primavera XML Baseline Projects**
  - Added ability to read and enumerate multiple baseline projects defined in Primavera XML files.

- **Encoding Control for Imports**
  - Developers can now explicitly set file encoding (e.g., `windows-1251`) when loading HTML, MPX, XER, or Primavera XML formats.

- **New SaveOptions Architecture**
  - Introduced `SimpleSaveOptions` to streamline saving to non-rendered formats like CSV, MPX, or XLSX by removing irrelevant view properties.

- **Baseline Budgeted Cost Properties**
  - New getters for budgeted labor, non-labor, material, expense, and total costs in `PrimaveraTaskProperties`.

### 🛠 Fixes and Enhancements

- **Project.Calendar Validation**
  - Ensures that the project's calendar points to a valid entry in the `Project.Calendars` collection.

- **View Filtering and Sorting**
  - Simplified view filtering via `CsvOptions.setView()` and `XlsxOptions.setView()` to fine-tune export content.

### 🔄 Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Added Types and Methods**
  - `SimpleSaveOptions`, `Project.save(String, SimpleSaveOptions)`
  - `LoadOptions.setEncoding(Charset)`
  - `PrimaveraTaskProperties.getBudgetedLaborCost()`, etc.

- **Removed Types and Methods**
  - Deprecated SaveOptions members not applicable to formats like MPX, CSV, XLSX.
  - Removed legacy Notes and LevelingDelayFormat fields from Task, Resource, and ResourceAssignment entities.
