# What's new in Aspose.Tasks for Java 24.9

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Tasks for Java 24.9 brings significant Gantt chart rendering improvements with new support for mid-bar shapes and refined baseline bar visualization. It also enhances task validation by adding task references to exceptions and resolves several critical calculation and rendering issues.

## New Features

- **Gantt Bar Mid-Shape Enhancements:**  
  Introduced new Gantt bar rendering capabilities including `RectangleBottom`, `LineMiddle`, and `LineTop` shapes, providing more control and fidelity in task visualization.

- **Task Reference in Exceptions:**  
  The `TaskValidationException` now includes a reference to the task that caused the exception, simplifying debugging and error tracking in complex project plans.

## Bug Fixes

- **Indent Removal in Gantt Bar Texts:**  
  Fixed an issue where task name indents were incorrectly rendered in Gantt chart bar labels.

- **Baseline Bar Rendering Improvements:**  
  Resolved multiple bugs affecting the accurate rendering of baseline bars in Gantt charts.

- **Assignment Calculation Corrections:**  
  Addressed calculation errors in `PeakUnits`, `ActualDuration`, and `Duration` for assignments using non-flat work contours.

- **Accurate Resource Usage Import:**  
  Fixed import issues with actual values in resource usage data to ensure integrity during file load operations.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

### Added Methods:

- `TaskValidationException.getTask()` – Retrieves the task that triggered the validation exception.
- `BarStyle.getStartShapeType()` / `setStartShapeType(int)`
- `BarStyle.getEndShapeType()` / `setEndShapeType(int)`
- `BarStyle.getFrom()` / `setFrom(int)`
- `BarStyle.getTo()` / `setTo(int)`

### Added Enumerations:

- `BarShape.HalfHeightBottom` – Bottom-aligned half-height bar shape for Gantt rendering.
- `BarShape.LineTop` – Top-aligned line shape for task bars.
- `Shape.Circle` – New shape option for bar styling.
