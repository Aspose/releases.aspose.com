# What's new in the Aspose.Tasks for Java 25.1

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Tasks for Java 25.1 introduces a major enhancement with the ability to create custom tables for resources, expanding layout flexibility. This release also resolves several important bugs related to task baselines, actual values, and MPP file reading accuracy.

## New Features and Enhancements

- **Support for Creating Resource Tables:**  
  Users can now programmatically define and add tables specifically for resources. This enhancement allows for more detailed data structuring and customized views in project files.

## Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Incorrect ActualStart and ActualFinish Read from MPP:**  
  Corrected the behavior when reading `Asn.ActualStart` and `Asn.ActualFinish` properties, ensuring proper data extraction from MPP formats.

- **Resolved Baseline Work Assigned to Unassigned Tasks and Weekends:**  
  Addressed an issue where baseline work values were incorrectly distributed to tasks with no assignments or during non-working days.

- **Fixed Actuals Overwriting Remaining Work:**  
  Fixed a bug where entering a zero-value actual incorrectly altered remaining work calculations in the output file.

- **Baseline Setting No Longer Affects Finish Dates:**  
  Fixed a critical bug where setting baselines erroneously replaced task finish dates with “NA”.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

No public API changes were introduced in this release.
