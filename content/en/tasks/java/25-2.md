# What's new in the Aspose.Tasks for Java 25.2

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Tasks for Java 25.2 focuses on refining the accuracy and consistency of baseline and timephased data across various project views. This release addresses critical bugs related to baseline cost display, start time alignment, and task usage view rollups.

## Bug Fixes

- **Baseline Work Discrepancies in Task Usage View:**  
  Fixed incorrect rollups and missing timephased data entries, ensuring accurate work summaries in task usage views.

- **Incorrect Start and Finish Dates in Timephased Data:**  
  Timephased data now reflects the correct start and finish dates, resolving inconsistencies during data extraction.

- **Zero Baseline Cost Now Visible in MS Project:**  
  Fixed an issue where timephased baseline cost data appeared empty when viewed in MS Project.

- **Start Time Aligned with Default Project Start Time:**  
  Tasks with unspecified time in start dates now correctly default to `Prj.DefaultStartTime`.

- **Fixed Pre-Hour Assignment Issues:**  
  Resolved problems where assignment data starting before standard working hours produced invalid timephased outputs in MPP.

- **Accurate Display of Cost Timephased Data in MS Project:**  
  Cost values are now correctly displayed when MPP files are opened in Microsoft Project.

- **Baseline Cost Timephased Data Calculation Fixed:**  
  Improved the calculation logic for baseline cost, ensuring accurate breakdown across time periods.
