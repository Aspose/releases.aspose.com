## Major Features

We are pleased to announce the December release of **Aspose.SVG for .NET 24.12.0**. This version introduces enhancements to SVG document rendering and conversion processes, resulting in a significant 15-20% reduction in memory consumption when dealing with large SVG documents. Additionally, we have upgraded **Aspose.SVG.Drawing.SkiaSharp** to the latest SkiaSharp 3.116.1, bringing better rendering performance, improved image handling, and more efficient text layout.

### Enhancements:

- **Improved Memory Efficiency for SVG Document Rendering and Conversion**:
In this release, we have optimized rendering and conversion processes for raster images, PDF, and XPS formats. These enhancements can reduce memory consumption by approximately 15-20% when working with large and complex SVG documents, resulting in better overall performance and stability.
- **Upgraded Aspose.SVG.Drawing.SkiaSharp to SkiaSharp 3.116.1**:
With this update, Aspose.SVG.Drawing.SkiaSharp now leverages the latest SkiaSharp release. Users will benefit from improved rendering speed, enhanced image handling, and more efficient text layout, contributing to a smoother and more reliable experience in a wide range of rendering scenarios.

### Announcement:

- **Postponed Removal of System.Drawing.Common API Methods to Version 25.1.0**:
The previously planned removal of System.Drawing.Common-based API methods has been further postponed to Aspose.SVG for .NET 25.1.0. This extension allows for additional testing and ensures that the transition will be smooth.
