## **Major Features**

We are pleased to announce the August release of Aspose.SVG for .NET 24.8.0. This release brings a performance enhancement in the area of image vectorization, alongside continued improvements to the overall toolkit.

### Bug Fixes:

- **Enhance Image Vectorization Performance (SVGNET-401):** We have improved the performance of raster image to SVG conversion by 10%. This optimization ensures a more efficient SVG generation process, particularly beneficial for handling complex or large raster images.

This update reflects our ongoing efforts to provide high-quality and performant SVG solutions across different platforms and use cases.
