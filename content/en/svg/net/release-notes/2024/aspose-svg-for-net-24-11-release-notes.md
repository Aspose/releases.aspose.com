## Major Features

We are pleased to announce the November release of **Aspose.SVG for .NET 24.11.0**. This release brings significant code optimizations that reduce memory consumption by the SVG DOM model and further decrease memory usage when rendering external HTML documents. These enhancements improve the overall performance and efficiency of the library, providing a smoother experience for developers and end-users.

### Enhancements:

- **Optimized Memory Consumption of SVG DOM Model**: We have implemented code optimizations within the SVG DOM model that significantly reduce memory usage during SVG processing. This improvement enhances performance, especially when working with complex SVG documents.
- **Further Reduced Memory Usage for Rendering External HTML Documents**: Building upon previous enhancements, we have further optimized the rendering process of external HTML documents. This results in a substantial decrease in memory footprint, leading to better performance and stability during rendering tasks.

### Announcement:

- **Postponed Removal of System.Drawing.Common API Methods to Version 24.12.0**: The planned removal of API methods that rely on System.Drawing.Common has been postponed to the next release, Aspose.SVG for .NET 24.12.0, to allow for additional testing. This delay ensures that the transition will be smooth and that the library maintains its high standards of compatibility and reliability. We recommend that developers take this additional time to review their codebases and prepare for the upcoming changes by adopting alternative methods for graphics rendering to maintain compatibility.
