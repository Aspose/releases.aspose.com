## **Major Features**

As per the regular monthly update process of all APIs being offered by Aspose, we are honored to announce the January release of Aspose.SVG for .NET:

* we added support for matching fonts to individual runs of text, which provides  for each character in the run a font family is chosen and a particular font face is selected containing a glyph for that character;

* we have reduced several times the amount of memory used when applying SVG filters;

* we fixed the issue causing loss of resolution when rendering inline svg images.
