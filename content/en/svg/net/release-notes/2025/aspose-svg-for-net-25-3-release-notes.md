## Major Features

We are pleased to announce the March release of **Aspose.SVG for .NET 25.3.0**. In this version, we have enhanced the rendering of SVG documents and refined how transformations are processed by introducing support for the `transform-origin` property. These updates allow developers to achieve more accurate and flexible transformations when working with SVG content in .NET applications.

## Enhancements and Fixes

- **Improved SVG Rendering**  
  Achieved more precise visual output and better color fidelity during the rendering process.
  
- **`transform-origin` Property Support**  
  Implemented handling of the `transform-origin` property, enabling finer control over element rotation and positioning.

- **Refined Transformation Properties**  
  Streamlined transformation logic for improved consistency and predictability across different platforms and use cases.
