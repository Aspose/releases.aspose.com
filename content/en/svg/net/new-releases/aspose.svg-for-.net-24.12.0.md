#### Release Highlights

Aspose.SVG for .NET 24.12 delivers a significant memory usage reduction when rendering or converting complex SVG documents. This release also upgrades the internal SkiaSharp engine, enhancing performance and compatibility for cross-platform .NET graphics applications.

  Rendering and converting SVG to raster, PDF, or XPS now consumes significantly less memory ‚Äî up to 20% in large-document scenarios ‚Äî improving efficiency and scalability.

- **SkiaSharp 3.116.1 Integration**  
  The bundled Aspose.SVG.Drawing.SkiaSharp library has been upgraded to the latest SkiaSharp version for faster rendering, better image fidelity, and more accurate text layout handling.

### üõ† Fix

- **Improved Rendering Reliability**  
  Performance and stability improvements were made throughout the rendering process, especially with large or complex SVG structures.

### üîß Public API Changes

- **No breaking or new public API changes** were introduced in this release.

### üö® Backwards Incompatible Changes
