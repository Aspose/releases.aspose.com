#### Release Highlights

Aspose.SVG for .NET 24.11 delivers performance-focused improvements for SVG developers. This release reduces memory consumption across both SVG DOM operations and external HTML rendering, ensuring smoother processing of complex graphics in .NET applications.

### ✳️ New Feature

- **Optimized SVG DOM Memory Usage**  
  Internal improvements to the SVG DOM model minimize memory allocation when processing complex documents, resulting in better efficiency.

### 🛠 Fix

- **Lower Memory Footprint for External HTML Rendering**  
  Rendering of external HTML content is now significantly more memory-efficient, benefiting applications with dynamic SVG or hybrid workflows.

### 🔧 Public API Changes

- **No API changes reported.**  
  This update focuses exclusively on internal optimizations with no impact on existing code.

### 🚨 Backwards Incompatible Changes

> ❗ Planned deprecation of `System.Drawing.Common`-based APIs has been **postponed to v24.12**, giving developers more time to migrate to cross-platform alternatives.
