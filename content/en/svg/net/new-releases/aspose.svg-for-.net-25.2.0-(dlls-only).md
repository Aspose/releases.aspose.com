#### Release Highlights

Aspose.SVG for .NET 25.2 (DLLs-only) is a lightweight release tailored for custom .NET builds. This version adds the `IBitmap` interface for image drawing and manipulation, `WebRotateFlipType` enum for image transformation, and improved rendering controls ‚Äî all without any dependency on System.Drawing.Common.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **New IBitmap Interface for Direct Image Manipulation**  
  Gain low-level access to drawing, rotating, and saving images using `IBitmap`, now returned from updated `IDrawingFactory` methods.

- **Consistent Rotation & Flip with WebRotateFlipType**  
  Built-in support for rotating and flipping images using a single, intuitive enum.

- **Improved Rendering Flags**  
  `UseAntialiasing` and `UseHinting` enable fine-grained rendering adjustments to enhance visual quality in image and font output.

### üõ† Fix

- **WebFontStyle Enum Clarity**  
  Descriptive updates improve usability and eliminate ambiguity in style selection during rendering.

### üîß Public API Changes

- **New Interfaces & Enums:**  
  `IBitmap`, `WebRotateFlipType`, extended `IDrawingFactory` overloads  
- **Refinements:**  
  Documentation improvements for `UseAntialiasing`, `UseHinting`, and `WebFontStyle`

### üö® Backwards Incompatible Changes

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The transition away from `System.Drawing.Common` is ongoing. Please begin migrating to `IBitmap` and the new rendering methods to maintain forward compatibility.
