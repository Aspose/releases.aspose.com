## Major Features

We are pleased to announce the November release of **Aspose.SVG for Python via .NET 24.11.0**. This release brings significant optimizations to enhance memory efficiency and performance during SVG processing and the rendering of external HTML documents. These improvements ensure a better experience for developers working with complex SVG workflows and external HTML content.

### Enhancements:

- **Optimized Memory Consumption of SVG DOM Model**: The SVG DOM model has been enhanced with improved memory management. These optimizations significantly reduce the memory footprint during SVG processing, resulting in faster and more efficient handling of complex documents.
- **Further Reduced Memory Usage for Rendering External HTML Documents**: Continuing our focus on memory optimization, this release includes additional improvements for rendering external HTML documents. These enhancements contribute to a smaller memory footprint and improved stability during rendering tasks.

### Announcement:

- **Postponed Removal of System.Drawing.Common API Methods to Version 24.12.0**: The planned removal of System.Drawing.Common API methods has been deferred to the next release, Aspose.SVG for Python via .NET 24.12.0, to allow for further testing and a smoother transition. Developers are encouraged to take this opportunity to review their projects and transition to alternative methods for graphics rendering to ensure compatibility in future releases.
