## Major Features

We are pleased to announce the December release of **Aspose.SVG for Python via .NET 24.12.0**. This version brings notable improvements in memory efficiency during SVG rendering and conversion, with a reduction of approximately 15-20% in memory consumption when processing large SVG documents. Additionally, we've upgraded **Aspose.SVG.Drawing.SkiaSharp** to SkiaSharp 3.116.1 for enhanced rendering performance. Moreover, this release now supports Python 3.12 and 3.13, ensuring compatibility with the latest Python environments.

### Enhancements:

- **Improved Memory Efficiency for SVG Document Rendering and Conversion**:  
  We've optimized the rendering and conversion workflows for raster images, PDF, and XPS formats. These optimizations can lower memory usage by about 15-20% for large and complex SVG documents, leading to better performance and stability.
  
- **Upgraded Aspose.SVG.Drawing.SkiaSharp to SkiaSharp 3.116.1**:  
  With this update, Aspose.SVG.Drawing.SkiaSharp benefits from the latest SkiaSharp release. Users can expect faster rendering speeds, better image handling, and more efficient text layout, resulting in a smoother, more reliable experience across various rendering scenarios.

- **Added Support for Python 3.12 and 3.13**:  
  Aspose.SVG for Python via .NET now supports Python 3.12 and 3.13, ensuring that users can leverage the library’s features and enhancements in the latest Python environments.

### Announcement:

- **Postponed Removal of System.Drawing.Common API Methods to Version 25.1.0**:  
  The previously announced plan to remove System.Drawing.Common-based API methods has been postponed to Aspose.SVG for Python via .NET 25.1.0. This delay allows for extended testing and ensures a smooth transition for users.
