## **Major Features**

We are pleased to announce the March release of **Aspose.SVG for Python via .NET 25.3.0.** This version focuses on refining the rendering of SVG documents and enhancing transformation handling through newly added support for the `transform-origin` property. These improvements aim to offer more precise and flexible control over how SVG elements are positioned and rendered in Python-based applications.

Below is a summary of the most significant updates:

### **Enhancements and Fixes**

1. **Improved SVG Rendering**
   - Enhanced internal rendering mechanisms to ensure crisper visuals and more accurate color fidelity.

2. **Transform-Origin Support**
   - Introduced handling of the `transform-origin` property for SVG elements.
   - Enables more precise transformations, giving developers granular control over rotation, scaling, and positioning.

3. **Refined Transformation Properties**
   - Streamlined the way transformation attributes are processed, resulting in more consistent and predictable transformations across platforms.
