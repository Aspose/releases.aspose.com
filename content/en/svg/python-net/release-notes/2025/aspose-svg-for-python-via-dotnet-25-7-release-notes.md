## Major Features

### New Classes and Properties

- **New DOM and CSS Classes:**  
  - `CSSValue` has been added (in the `aspose.svg.dom.css` module).
  - `Document` and `DocumentFragment` are now part of the API (in the `aspose.svg.dom` module).
  - `IEventTarget` (in the `aspose.svg.dom.events` module) has been introduced.
  - New collection types: `NodeList` and `HTMLCollection` (in `aspose.svg.collections`).
  - `DocumentType` has been added.

- **New Properties:**  
  - `prefix` and `namespace_uri` have been added to multiple API types.
  - `parent_element` has been added to select types to enhance namespace and parent relationship support.

### Enhanced Event Handling and Node Operations

- **Event Listener Methods:**  
  - The behavior of various `add_event_listener` methods and the `IEventListener` interface has been updated and clarified.
  
- **DOM Methods:**  
  - Methods such as `append_child`, `remove_child`, and `clone_node` (including the `deep` parameter) now have clearer contracts and improved behavior when modifying the DOM tree.

### Updated CSS and Saving Options

- **CSS Changes:**  
  - The `css_text` property in CSS-related types has been updated to better explain its role.

- **Saving Options:**  
  - The new `SVGZSaveOptions` class offers options for saving SVG files in compressed SVGZ format.
  - The `save` method now supports both plain-SVG and compressed SVGZ file outputs.

## Enhancements and Fixes

- **Method Consistency and Clarity:**  
  - Several API members (e.g., `get_platform_type`, `get_elements_by_tag_name`/`_ns`, and various event listener overloads) have been revised to improve clarity, parameter descriptions, and error handling.
  
- **Detailed Parameter Descriptions:**  
  - Updates to methods such as `clone_node`, `append_child`, and event dispatching ensure clear guidance on how to use these methods.
