## Public API Changes ##

### Text Animation Effect - AnimateTextType enum has been added ###

The new AnimateTextType enum has been added and it represents the animate text type of an animation effect. It allows to set the following text animation types:
- animate all text at once
- animate text by word
- animate text by letter

Example:

``` php
$presentation = new Presentation("demo.pptx");

# Get the first effect of the first slide.
$firstSlideEffect = $presentation->getSlides()->get_Item(0)->getTimeline()->getMainSequence()->get_Item(0);

# Change the effect Animate text type to "By letter"
$firstSlideEffect->setAnimateTextType(AnimateTextType::ByLetter);

$presentation->dispose();
```
