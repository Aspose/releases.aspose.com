# Improved ODP Encryption / Decryption

It was observed that the when encryption or decryption of the OpenDocument Presentation `ODP` format files were being done an exception was being thrown. This version of the API offers a resolution to such issues.

# Improved PPT to PDF Conversion

This release of the API offers numerous improvements when it comes to converting the Microsoft PowerPoint&reg; PPT presentations to Adobe Acrobat&reg; PDF files, such as:

- Image was missing when converting PPT to PDF.
- PPT to PDF conversion crashes without messages.
- Text wrapping is not applied when converting PPT to PDF.

All the aforementioned issues have been resolved within this release.

# Improved PPTX to PPS Conversion

Previously while saving PPTX as PPS it was noticed that slide background is being lost. This issue has been resolved.
