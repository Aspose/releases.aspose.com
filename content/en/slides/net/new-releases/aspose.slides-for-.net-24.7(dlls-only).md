We are thrilled to announce the availability of Aspose.Slides for .NET 24.7 (DLLs only). The DLLs package delivers a range of enhancements to enrich your presentation processing capabilities and convenient integration. 

### PDF Conversion Accuracy

Incorporate accurate PDF conversion functionality into your C# presentation conversion applications and enjoy excellent fidelity while converting presentations to PDFs, including charts, text, and layouts with the latest version of the .NET presentations API. This code example highlights the feature usage.

```c#

using (Presentation pres = new Presentation("pres.pptx"))
{
    PdfOptions options = new PdfOptions { IncludeOleData = true };
    
    pres.Save("pres.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf, options);
}

```

### Beefed Up Security

Eliminate malicious content, such as VBA macros and OLE objects from PowerPoint presentations during the loading process using the new `DeleteEmbeddedBinaryObjects` property, as illustrated in this code sample.

```c#

LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions() { DeleteEmbeddedBinaryObjects = true };

using (var pres = new Presentation("malware.ppt", loadOptions))
{
    pres.Save("clean.ppt", SaveFormat.Ppt);
}

```
