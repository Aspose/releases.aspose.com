### üîß Enhancement

- Improved bullet rendering and alignment in slide-to-image conversion.
- Enhanced font consistency for PDF/HTML export with fonts like Walbaum Display.

### üõ† Fix

- Fixed missing text/image shadows in PPTX to HTML5.
- Corrected inaccurate text and label positions in PDF, SVG, and thumbnails.
- Resolved issues with lost animation motion, Excel icon visibility, and modern comment positioning.
- Eliminated memory leak during thumbnail generation.

### üîç Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Removed**: Obsolete `NotesCommentsLayouting` properties from:
  - `HtmlOptions`, `PdfOptions`, `TiffOptions`, `RenderingOptions`
