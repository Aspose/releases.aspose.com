# Improved `PPTX` to `PDF` Conversion

This API release offers multiple enhancements for converting PowerPoint&reg; PPTX to Acrobat&reg; PDF, some of those are as follows:

- Correct encoding for the Calibri font while converting PPTX to PDF.
- Issue resolution where PPTX to PDF conversion used to generate incorrect output and threw exception.
- Resolved issue where the `EMF` image used to be missed in converting PPTX to PDF.

```csharp
// Instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PowerPoint.pptx");

// Setting array of slides positions
int[] slides = { 1, 3 };

// Save the presentation as PDF
presentation.Save("PPTX-to-PDF.pdf", slides, SaveFormat.Pdf);
```

# Support of 3D Effects for Rotation

Introduced the support of 3D rotation effects within the API.
