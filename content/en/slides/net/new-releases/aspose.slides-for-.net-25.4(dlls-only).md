#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Slides for .NET 25.4 DLLs-only brings critical fixes across PDF and SVG exports, missing image rendering, shape corruption, and font alignment. Also includes shape property typing and metered licensing API support.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Shape Adjustment Typing**: `IAdjustValue.Type` reveals shape-specific adjustment behavior.
- **License Status API**: Quickly verify runtime licensing with `Metered.IsMeteredLicensed()`.

### üîß Enhancement

- Multithreaded stability for `GetThumbnail()` in concurrent environments.
- Platform support update notice for .NET 2.0 to 4.0 frameworks (ending with v25.7).

### üõ† Fix

- Repaired malformed equations, clipped bullets, and misaligned fonts in PPT/PDF exports.
- Fixed image absence in PPTX > PDF conversions and distorted SmartArt in PPT saves.
- Addressed issues with text box size, underlines, superscripts, and file hangs during PPTX load.

### üîç Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New API**:
  - `Metered.IsMeteredLicensed()` for license validation.
  - `IAdjustValue.Type` for shape tweak insights.
- **Deprecation**:
  - Support for .NET Framework 2.0/3.5/4.0 to be removed in v25.7.
