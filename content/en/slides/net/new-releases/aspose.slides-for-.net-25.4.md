- Prepared for deprecation of legacy .NET Framework targets in version 25.7.

### üõ† Fix

- Resolved layout glitches for text boxes, page numbers, equations, and superscripts in various formats.
- Corrected missing shapes, images, and font sizing inconsistencies during ODP, SVG, and SmartArt conversions.

### üîç Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes
