## **Public API Changes**
### Partial support of Map charts has been added
Partial support of Map charts has been added. It means that you can create, edit, and save charts. Rendering options are limited since Microsoft Office uses Bing data provider for generating chart image. 
So any changes related to the Map charts made within Aspose.Slides won't affect the rendering results. 
If the chart was loaded from an input file, the cached image from the PPTX package will be used for rendering purposes. 

Following enum values have been added:

- **[CombinableSeriesTypesGroup](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.charts/combinableseriestypesgroup).MapChart**

- **[ChartType](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/aspose.cells.charts/charttype).Map**

Methods:

- **[IChartDataPointCollection.AddDataPointForMapSeries(Aspose.Slides.Charts.IChartDataCell)](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.charts/ichartdatapointcollection/methods/adddatapointformapseries)**

Properties:

- **[IChartDataPoint.ColorValue](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.charts/ichartdatapoint/properties/colorvalue)**

Following **example** shows how to create a map chart from scratch:
```csharp
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation())
{    
    //create empty chart
    IChart chart = presentation.Slides[0].Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.Map, 50, 50, 500, 400, false);
    
    IChartDataWorkbook wb = chart.ChartData.ChartDataWorkbook;

    //Add series and few data points
    IChartSeries series = chart.ChartData.Series.Add(ChartType.Map);
    series.DataPoints.AddDataPointForMapSeries(wb.GetCell(0, "B2", 5));
    series.DataPoints.AddDataPointForMapSeries(wb.GetCell(0, "B3", 1));    
    series.DataPoints.AddDataPointForMapSeries(wb.GetCell(0, "B4", 10));
    
    //add categories
    chart.ChartData.Categories.Add(wb.GetCell(0, "A2", "United States"));
    chart.ChartData.Categories.Add(wb.GetCell(0, "A3", "Mexico"));
    chart.ChartData.Categories.Add(wb.GetCell(0, "A4", "Brazil"));

    //change data point value    
    IChartDataPoint dataPoint = series.DataPoints[1];    
    dataPoint.ColorValue.AsCell.Value = "15";
    
    //set data point appearance    
    dataPoint.Format.Fill.FillType = FillType.Solid;
    dataPoint.Format.Fill.SolidFillColor.Color = Color.Green;

    presentation.Save("output.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
```


* *When you first open a presentation in PP it may take a few seconds to upload an image of the chart from the Bing service since we don't provide the cached image.*

### Checking password to open via IPresentationInfo interface
**[CheckPassword](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/ipresentationinfo/methods/checkpassword)** 
method has been added to **[IPresentationInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/ipresentationinfo)** 
interface and **[PresentationInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentationinfo)** class. 
This method allows checking whether a presentation is protected by a password to open.

Method declaration:
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Checks whether a password is correct for a presentation protected with open password.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="password">The password to check.</param>
/// <returns>
/// True if the presentation is protected with open password and the password is correct and false otherwise.
/// </returns>
/// <remarks>
/// When the password is null or empty, this method returns false.
/// </remarks>
bool CheckPassword(string password);
```

The example below demonstrates how to check a password to open a presentation:
```csharp
IPresentationInfo info = PresentationFactory.Instance.GetPresentationInfo("pres.pptx");
bool isPasswordCorrect = info.CheckPassword("my_password");
```

### ITextFrameFormat.KeepTextFlat property has been added
A new property **[KeepTextFlat](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/itextframeformat/properties/keeptextflat)** 
has been added to **[ITextFrameFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/itextframeformat)** interface.

Using this property allows to keep text out of 3D scene entirely.

Property declaration:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Returns or set keeping text out of 3D scene entirely.
/// Read/write <see cref="bool"/>.
/// </summary>
bool KeepTextFlat { get; set; }
```

The code snippet below demonstrates setting keep text out of 3D scene:

```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation("Presentation.pptx"))
{
    IAutoShape shape = pres.Slides[0].Shapes[0] as AutoShape;
    if (shape != null)
    {
        shape.TextFrame.TextFrameFormat.KeepTextFlat = true;
    }
}
```
