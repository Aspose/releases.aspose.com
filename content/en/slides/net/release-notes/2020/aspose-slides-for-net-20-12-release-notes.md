## **Public API Changes**
### PDF Import
PDF Import feature has been added. This feature allows importing a PDF document into 
[Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation). 
A new **[SlideCollection.AddFromPdf](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.slidecollection/addfrompdf/methods/1)** 
method creates slides from the PDF document and adds them to the end of the collection:

```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
pres.Slides.AddFromPdf("document.pdf");
pres.Save("fromPdfDocument.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
```

### IInk interface has been added
**[IInk](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.ink/iink)** 
interface and Ink implementer class have been added. They represent an **[IInk](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.ink/iink)** 
graphical element.

**[IInk](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.ink/iink)**  declaration:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Represents an ink object on a slide.
/// </summary>
public interface IInk : IGraphicalObject
{
}
```
