## **Public API Changes**
#### **IShape.AlternativeTextTitle property has been added**
A new property AlternativeTextTitle has been added to IShape interface and Shape class.

It allows to get or set the title of alternative text associated with a shape.

Sample code demonstrating setting alternative text title:

``` csharp
Presentation presentation = new Presentation();
IAutoShape shape = presentation.Slides[0].Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 100, 50, 300, 150);
shape.AlternativeTextTitle = "Alt text title";
```
