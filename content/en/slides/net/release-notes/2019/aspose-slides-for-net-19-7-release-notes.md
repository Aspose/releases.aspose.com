## **Public API Changes**
#### **Another option has been added for setting external workbook path**
Method **SetExternalWorkbook**(string *workbookPath*, bool *updateChartData*) has been added. 

Parameter **updateChartData** defines whether excel workbook will be loaded or not. If value is false only workbook path will be updated.  Chart data won't be loaded and updated from the target workbook. It's useful when target workbook doesn't exist yet or is not available. If value is true chart data will be updated from the target workbook as regular method SetExternalWorkbook does.



``` csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
      IChart chart = pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.Pie, 50, 50, 400, 600, true);
      IChartData chartData = chart.ChartData;
      (chartData as ChartData).SetExternalWorkbook("http://path/doesnt/exists", false);
}
``` 
In some scenarios user have to implement retrieving of workbook data on his own. For example if access to the source protected by password. In such cases user can use IResourceLoadingCallback.

``` csharp
public void SetExternalWorkbookMethodNetwork()
{
   string externalWbPath = @"http://606178d2.ngrok.io/webgrind/styles/2.xlsx";
   LoadOptions opts = new LoadOptions();
   opts.ResourceLoadingCallback = new WorkbookLoadingHandler();
   using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(opts))
   {
      IChart chart = pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.Pie, 50, 50, 400, 600, false);
      IChartData chartData = chart.ChartData;
      (chartData as ChartData).SetExternalWorkbook(externalWbPath);
   }
}

private class WorkbookLoadingHandler : IResourceLoadingCallback
{
   public ResourceLoadingAction ResourceLoading(IResourceLoadingArgs args)
   {
      string workbookPath = args.OriginalUri;
      if (workbookPath.IndexOf(':') > 1 && !workbookPath.StartsWith("file:///")) // schemed path
      {
         try
         {
            WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create(workbookPath);
            request.Credentials = new System.Net.NetworkCredential("testuser", "testuser");
            using (WebResponse response = request.GetResponse())
            using (Stream responseStream = response.GetResponseStream())
            {
                byte[] buffer = BlobDownloadManager.Download(responseStream);
                args.SetData(buffer);
                return ResourceLoadingAction.UserProvided;
            }
          }
          catch (Exception ex)
          {
             throw new InvalidOperationException(ex.ToString());
          }
      }
      else
      {
          return ResourceLoadingAction.Default;
      }
   }
} 
``` 


### **New AddEffect method has been added to Sequence class and ISequence interface**
**AddEffect(IParagraph paragraph, EffectType effectType, EffectSubtype subtype, EffectTriggerType triggerType)** method has been added to **ISequence** interface and **Sequence** class.

It allows to add new animation effect for single paragraph.

Usage example:

``` csharp
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation(path + "input.pptx")
{
	// select paragraph to add effect
	IAutoShape autoShape = (IAutoShape)presentation.Slides[0].Shapes[0];
	IParagraph paragraph = autoShape.TextFrame.Paragraphs[0];
	
	// add Fly animation effect to selected paragraph
	IEffect effect = presentation.Slides[0].Timeline.MainSequence.AddEffect(paragraph, EffectType.Fly, EffectSubtype.Left, EffectTriggerType.OnClick);
}


```
