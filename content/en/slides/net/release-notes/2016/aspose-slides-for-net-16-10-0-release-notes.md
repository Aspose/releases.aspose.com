## **Public API Changes**
#### **ISlide.Reset() method has been added**
public void Reset() method has been added to ISlide interface and Slide class.

It mimics slide 'Reset' functionality in PowerPoint. The method resets position, size and formatting of every shape that has a prototype on LayoutSlide. Also it recovers deleted placeholders.
#### **Property IBaseSlide.ShowMasterShapes has been added**
Property ShowMasterShapes has been added to interface Aspose.Slides.IBaseSlides and to class Aspose.Slides.BaseSlide. It specifies if shapes on the master slide should be shown on slides (ISlide, ILayoutSlide or INotesLides) or not. For master slide itself this property always returns 'false' and doesn't allow to set 'true'.
