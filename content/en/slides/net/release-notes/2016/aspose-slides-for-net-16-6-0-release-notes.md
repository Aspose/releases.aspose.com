## **Public API Changes**
### **New elements have been added into Aspose.Slides.LoadFormat enumeration**
Aspose.Slides.LoadFormat enumeration has been extended with new elements: Potx, Pptm, Ppsm, Potm.

### **New methods ReadDocumentProperties, UpdateDocumentProperties, and WriteBindedPresentation have been added to IPresentationInfo, logic of the IDocumentProperties.LastSavedTime property setter has been changed**
The two new methods ReadDocumentProperties and UpdateDocumentProperties have been added to IPresentationInfo interface. They provide a quick access to document properties and allow to change and update properties without loading a whole presentation.

The typical scenario load the properties, change some value and update the document can be implemented in the following way:

``` csharp
// read the info of presentation
IPresentationInfo info = PresentationFactory.Instance.GetPresentationInfo("presentation.pptx");

// obtain the current properties
IDocumentProperties props = info.ReadDocumentProperties();

// set the new values of Author and Title fields
props.Author = "New Author";
props.Title = "New Title";

// update the presentation with a new values
info.UpdateDocumentProperties(props);
info.WriteBindedPresentation("updated_presentation.pptx");
``` 

There's an another way to use properties of a particular presentation as a template to update properties in other presentations:
``` csharp
private void UpdateByTemplate()
{
  DocumentProperties template;
  IPresentationInfo info = PresentationFactory.Instance.GetPresentationInfo("template.pptx");
  template = (DocumentProperties)info.ReadDocumentProperties();

  template.Author = "Template Author";
  template.Title = "Template Title";
  template.Category = "Template Category";
  template.Keywords = "Keyword1, Keyword2, Keyword3";
  template.Company = "Our Company";
  template.Comments = "Created from template";
  template.ContentType = "Template Content";
  template.Subject = "Template Subject";

  UpdateByTemplate("doc1.pptx", template);
  UpdateByTemplate("doc2.odp", template);
  UpdateByTemplate("doc3.ppt", template);
}

private void UpdateByTemplate(string path, IDocumentProperties template)
{
    IPresentationInfo toUpdate = PresentationFactory.Instance.GetPresentationInfo(path);
    toUpdate.UpdateDocumentProperties(template);
    toUpdate.WriteBindedPresentation(path);
}
``` 

Or a new template can be created from scratch and then used to update multiple presentations:

``` csharp
private void UpdateByTemplate()
{
    DocumentProperties template = new DocumentProperties()
    {
        Author = "Template Author",
        Title = "Template Title",
        Category = "Template Category",
        Keywords = "Keyword1, Keyword2, Keyword3",
        Company = "Our Company",
        Comments = "Created from template",
        ContentType = "Template Content",
        Subject = "Template Subject"
    };

    UpdateByTemplate("doc1.pptx", template);
    UpdateByTemplate("doc2.odp", template);
    UpdateByTemplate("doc3.ppt", template);
}

private void UpdateByTemplate(string path, IDocumentProperties template)
{
    IPresentationInfo toUpdate = PresentationFactory.Instance.GetPresentationInfo(path);
    toUpdate.UpdateDocumentProperties(template);
    toUpdate.WriteBindedPresentation(path);
}
``` 

Also, CreatedTime and LastPrinted properties of IDocumentProperties have been made readable and writable. IDocumentProperties.LastSavedTime has made writable too, but only if it is created as a standalone object or returned by IPresentationInfo.ReadDocumentProperties() method (not if it is returned by IPresentation.DocumentProperties property).
