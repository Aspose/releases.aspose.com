## **Public API Changes**
#### **InvertedSolidFillColor property has been added**
IColorFormat InvertedSolidFillColor property has been added to ChartSeries class and to IChartSeries interface.

It allows to specify inverted solid color for series. To apply this color setting, set series FillType format to FillType.Solid.

``` csharp
Color inverColor = Color.Red;
Color seriesColor;
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    IChart chart = p.Slides[0].Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.ClusteredColumn, 100, 100, 400, 300);
    IChartDataWorkbook workBook = chart.ChartData.ChartDataWorkbook;

    chart.ChartData.Series.Clear();
    chart.ChartData.Categories.Clear();

    // Adding new series
    chart.ChartData.Series.Add(workBook.GetCell(0, 0, 1, "Series 1"), chart.Type);

    // Adding new categories
    chart.ChartData.Categories.Add(workBook.GetCell(0, 1, 0, "Category 1"));
    chart.ChartData.Categories.Add(workBook.GetCell(0, 2, 0, "Category 2"));
    chart.ChartData.Categories.Add(workBook.GetCell(0, 3, 0, "Category 3"));

    // Take first chart series
    IChartSeries series = chart.ChartData.Series[0];

    // Now populating series data
    series.DataPoints.AddDataPointForBarSeries(workBook.GetCell(0, 1, 1, -20));
    series.DataPoints.AddDataPointForBarSeries(workBook.GetCell(0, 2, 1, 50));
    series.DataPoints.AddDataPointForBarSeries(workBook.GetCell(0, 3, 1, -30));
    seriesColor = series.GetAutomaticSeriesColor();
    series.InvertIfNegative = true;
    series.Format.Fill.FillType = FillType.Solid;
    series.Format.Fill.SolidFillColor.Color = seriesColor;
    series.InvertedSolidFillColor.Color = inverColor;

    pres.Save(outPath, SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
``` 
#### **Obsolete members related to PropertyType enum have been deleted**
``` csharp
Aspose.Slides.Animation.BehaviorProperty.GetByType(Aspose.Slides.Animation.PropertyType)
Aspose.Slides.Animation.BehaviorPropertyCollection.Add(Aspose.Slides.Animation.PropertyType)
Aspose.Slides.Animation.BehaviorPropertyCollection.Contains(Aspose.Slides.Animation.PropertyType)
Aspose.Slides.Animation.BehaviorPropertyCollection.IndexOf(Aspose.Slides.Animation.PropertyType)
Aspose.Slides.Animation.BehaviorPropertyCollection.Insert(System.Int32,Aspose.Slides.Animation.PropertyType)
Aspose.Slides.Animation.BehaviorPropertyCollection.Remove(Aspose.Slides.Animation.PropertyType)
```
#### **Obsolete enum Aspose.Slides.Animation.PropertyType has been deleted.**
