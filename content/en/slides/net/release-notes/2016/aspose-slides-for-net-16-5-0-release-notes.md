## **Public API Changes**
#### **Property Picture has been added to IBulletFormat interface and BulletFormat class**
This property represents the picture used as a bullet in the paragraph.

Code snippet:
``` csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
     //Accessing the first slide
     ISlide slide = pres.Slides[0];
     
	 //Instantiate the image for bullets
     Image img = new Bitmap("bullet.png");
     IPPImage imgx = pres.Images.AddImage(img);
     
	 //Adding and accessing Autoshape
     IAutoShape aShp = slide.Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 200, 200, 400, 200);
     
	 //Accessing the text frame of created autoshape
     ITextFrame txtFrm = aShp.TextFrame;
     
	 //Removing the default exisiting paragraph
     txtFrm.Paragraphs.RemoveAt(0);
     
	 //Creating new paragraph
     Paragraph para = new Paragraph();
     para.Text = "Welcome to Aspose.Slides";

     //Setting paragraph bullet style and image
     para.ParagraphFormat.Bullet.Type = BulletType.Picture;
     para.ParagraphFormat.Bullet.Picture.Image = imgx;

     //Setting Bullet Height
     para.ParagraphFormat.Bullet.Height = 100;

     //Adding Paragraph to text frame
     txtFrm.Paragraphs.Add(para);

     //Writing the presentation as a PPTX file
     pres.Save("Bullet.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);

     //Writing the presentation as a PPT file
     pres.Save("Bullet.ppt", SaveFormat.Ppt);

     //Writing the presentation as a ODP file
     pres.Save("Bullet.odp", SaveFormat.Odp);
}
```

{
	//Instantiate the PdfOptions class
	PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
