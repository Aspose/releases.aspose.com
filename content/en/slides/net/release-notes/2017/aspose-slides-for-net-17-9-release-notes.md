## **Public API Changes**
#### **Added possibility to specify fonts used with a presentation**
A new DocumentLevelFontSources property has been added to ILoadOptions interface. It allows to specify external fonts that are used with the presentation.

DocumentLevelFontSources property is of type IFontSources that has the following properties:

- string[] FontFolders - folders that are recursively searched for font files.
- byte[][] MemoryFonts - a collection of fonts represented as byte arrays.

``` csharp
byte[] memoryFont1 = File.ReadAllBytes("customfonts\\CustomFont1.ttf");
byte[] memoryFont2 = File.ReadAllBytes("customfonts\\CustomFont2.ttf");
ILoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions();
loadOptions.DocumentLevelFontSources.FontFolders = new string[] { "assets\\fonts", "global\\fonts" };
loadOptions.DocumentLevelFontSources.MemoryFonts = new byte[][] { memoryFont1, memoryFont2 };
using (IPresentation presentation = CreatePresentation("MyPresentation.pptx", loadOptions))
{
  //work with the presentation
  //CustomFont1, CustomFont2 as well as fonts from assets\fonts & global\fonts folders and their subfolders are available to the presentation
}
``` 

The fonts that are passed with DocumentLevelFontSources property are available to the presentation throughout its lifetime and are not available outside the presentation. Consider the following example:

``` csharp
string[] fontFolders1 = new string[] { "assets\\fonts" };
string[] fontFolders2 = new string[] { "global\\fonts" };

byte[] memoryFont1 = File.ReadAllBytes("customfonts\\CustomFont1.ttf");
byte[] memoryFont2 = File.ReadAllBytes("customfonts\\CustomFont2.ttf");

IFontSources fontSources1 = new FontSources { FontFolders = fontFolders1, MemoryFonts = new byte[][] { memoryFont1 } };
IFontSources fontSources2 = new FontSources { FontFolders = fontFolders2, MemoryFonts = new byte[][] { memoryFont2 } };

using (IPresentation presentation1 = CreatePresentation("MyPresentation1.pptx", new LoadOptions { DocumentLevelFontSources = fontSources1 }))
using (IPresentation presentation2 = CreatePresentation("MyPresentation2.pptx", new LoadOptions { DocumentLevelFontSources = fontSources2 }))
{
  //work with the presentations
  //CustomFont1 as well as fonts from assets\fonts folder and its subfolders are available to presentation1 but not to presentation2
  //CustomFont2 as well as fonts from global\fonts folder and its subfolders are available to presentation2 but not to presentation1
}
``` 

If you need to add external fonts at application level and make it available to all presentations please use FonsLoader class. You can use them together like as follows:

``` csharp
byte[] globalMemoryFont = File.ReadAllBytes("customfonts\\CustomFont1.ttf");
byte[] localMemoryFont = File.ReadAllBytes("customfonts\\CustomFont2.ttf");

ILoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions();
loadOptions.DocumentLevelFontSources.FontFolders = new string[] { "assets\\fonts" };
loadOptions.DocumentLevelFontSources.MemoryFonts = new byte[][] { localMemoryFont };

using (IPresentation presentation = CreatePresentation("MyPresentation.pptx", loadOptions))
{
  //work with the presentation
  //CustomFont2 as well as fonts from assets\fonts folder and its subfolders are available to the presentation
  //CustomFont1 as well as fonts from global\fonts folder and its subfolders are unavailable to the presentation
}

FontsLoader.LoadExternalFonts(new string[] { "global\\fonts" });
FontsLoader.LoadExternalFont(globalMemoryFont);

using (IPresentation presentation = CreatePresentation("MyPresentation.pptx", loadOptions))
{
  //work with the presentation
  //CustomFont1 and CustomFont2 as well as fonts from global\fonts and assets\fonts folders and their subfolders are available to the presentation
}
``` 
#### **CategoryAxisType.Auto value has been replaced with IAxis.SetCategoryAxisTypeAutomatically() method**
Method IAxis.SetCategoryAxisTypeAutomatically() sets IAxis.CategoryAxisType property with a value that is automatically determined based on axis data.
#### **Element HtmlNotes has been added to SaveFormat enumeration**
Element HtmlNotes has been added to Aspose.Slides.Export.SaveFormat enumeration. This element allows saving presentation Notes Page View into HTML format.

Code example:

``` csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation("Presentation.pptx"))
{
  // Saving notes pages
  pres.Save("Output.html", SaveFormat.HtmlNotes);
}
``` 

#### **Obsolete Presentation.GetPresentationText methods have been deleted**
Obsolete Presentation.GetPresentationText methods have been deleted:

``` csharp
Aspose.Slides.Presentation.GetPresentationText(Stream stream, TextExtractionArrangingMode mode)
Aspose.Slides.Presentation.GetPresentationText(String file, TextExtractionArrangingMode mode)
Aspose.Slides.Presentation.GetPresentationText(Stream stream, TextExtractionArrangingMode mode, LoadOptions options)
``` 

#### **Write document elements methods have been made virtual in EmbedAllFontsHtmlController class. WriteAllFonts method has been Added.**
WriteDocumentStart, WriteDocumentEnd, WriteSlideStart, WriteSlideEnd, WriteShapeStart, WriteShapeEnd methods have been made virtual to provide a better support to customize generated HTML documents.

In addition, WriteAllFonts method has been added. It allows overriding the way how all fonts contained in the presentation are serialized into HTML.

Please review the example how to use overridable methods to create a custom HTML document with a link to CSS file.

``` csharp
public class CustomHeaderAndFontsController : EmbedAllFontsHtmlController
{
  // Custom header template
  const string Header = +"<!DOCTYPE html>\n" +
      "<html>\n" +
	  "<head>\n" +
	  "<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\n" +
	  "<meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=9\">\n" +
	  "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"{0}\">\n" +
	  "</head>";
	  
  private readonly string m_cssFileName;

  public CustomHeaderAndFontsController(string cssFileName)
  {
    m_cssFileName = cssFileName;
  }

  public override void WriteDocumentStart(IHtmlGenerator generator, IPresentation presentation)
  {
    generator.AddHtml(string.Format(Header, m_cssFileName));
    WriteAllFonts(generator, presentation);
  }

  public override void WriteAllFonts(IHtmlGenerator generator, IPresentation presentation)
  {
    generator.AddHtml("<!-- Embedded fonts -->");
    base.WriteAllFonts(generator, presentation);
  }
}
``` 

There is the example how CustomHeaderAndFontsController can be used.

``` csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation("pres.pptx"))
{
  CustomHeaderAndFontsController htmlController = new CustomHeaderAndFontsController("styles.css");
  HtmlOptions options = new HtmlOptions
  {
    HtmlFormatter = HtmlFormatter.CreateCustomFormatter(htmlController),
  };
  
  pres.Save("pres.html", SaveFormat.Html, options);
}
```
