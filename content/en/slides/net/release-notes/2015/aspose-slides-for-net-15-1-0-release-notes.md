## **Public API Changes**

#### **Fonts substitutions functinality has been added**
Possibility to replace font globally across the presentation and temporary for rendering has been added.

New property "FontsManager" of Presentation class has been introduced. FontsManager class has following members:

**IFontSubstRuleCollection FontSubstRuleList Property**
This collection of IFontSubstRule instancesusing to substitute fonts during rendering.IFontSubstRule hasSourceFont andDestFont properties implementing IFontData interface andReplaceFontCondition property allowing to choose condition of replacement ("WhenInaccessible" or "Always").

**IFontData GetFonts() Method**
Using to retrieve all fonts uisng in the current presentation.

**ReplaceFont Methods**
Using to persistently replace font in the presentation.

The following example shows how to replace font in the presentation:

``` csharp
Presentation pres = new Presentation("PresContainsArialFont.pptx");

IFontData sourceFont = new FontData("Arial");
IFontData destFont = new FontData("Times New Roman");

pres.FontsManager.ReplaceFont(sourceFont, destFont);
pres.Save("PresContainsTimesNoewRomanFont.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

Another example, demonstrates font substitution for rendering when inaccessible:

``` csharp
Presentation pres = new Presentation("PresContainsSomeRareFontFont.pptx");

IFontData sourceFont = new FontData("SomeRareFont");
IFontData destFont = new FontData("Arial");

IFontSubstRule fontSubstRule = new FontSubstRule(
	sourceFont, destFont, FontSubstCondition.WhenInaccessible);
IFontSubstRuleCollection fontSubstRuleCollection = new FontSubstRuleCollection();
fontSubstRuleCollection.Add(fontSubstRule);

pres.FontsManager.FontSubstRuleList = fontSubstRuleCollection;

// Arial font will be used instead of SomeRareFont when inaccessible
pres.Slides[0].GetThumbnail();
```
