## **Public API Changes**
#### **Support for setting X and Y properties has been added to SmartArtShape class**
Aspose.Slides for .NET versions from 14.9 to 17.6 did not support RawFrame, Frame, Rotation, X, Y, Width and Height properties of SmartArtShape class and thrown System.NotSupportedException on attempt of setting them. Since Aspose.Slides for .NET version 17.7 SmartArtShape supports setting Frame, Rotation, Width and Height properties.

Now in Aspose.Slides for .NET version 18.5 support for setting SmartArtShape X and Y properties has been added.

The code snippet below shows how to set custom SmartArtShape position, size and rotation (please note that adding new nodes causes a recalculation of the positions and sizes of all nodes):

``` csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
  ISmartArt smart = pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddSmartArt(20, 20, 600, 500, SmartArtLayoutType.OrganizationChart);

  // Move SmartArt shape to new position
  ISmartArtNode node = smart.AllNodes[1];
  ISmartArtShape shape = node.Shapes[1];
  shape.X += (shape.Width * 2);
  shape.Y -= (shape.Height / 2);

  // Change SmartArt shape's widths
  node = smart.AllNodes[2];
  shape = node.Shapes[1];
  shape.Width += (shape.Width / 2);

  // Change SmartArt shape's height
  node = smart.AllNodes[3];
  shape = node.Shapes[1];
  shape.Height += (shape.Height / 2);

  // Change SmartArt shape's rotation
  node = smart.AllNodes[4];
  shape = node.Shapes[1];
  shape.Rotation = 90;

  pres.Save(path + "SmartArt.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
```
