## **Public API Changes**
#### **INotesCommentsLayoutingOptions.ShowCommentsByNoAuthor property have been added**
INotesCommentsLayoutingOptions.ShowCommentsByNoAuthor property have been added.

Specifies the visibility of comments that do not have an author.

The default value for this property is false, which means that comments without authors are not displayed.

``` csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation("no-author.odp"))
{
  PdfOptions options = new PdfOptions();
  options.NotesCommentsLayouting.CommentsPosition = CommentsPositions.Right;
  options.NotesCommentsLayouting.ShowCommentsByNoAuthor = true;

  pres.Save("out_pres.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf, options);
}
```
