## Public API Changes ##

## IMathParagraph.ToLatex method added ##

Added a new method IMathParagraph.ToLatex, which allows to convert math text to Latex format.

Example:

``` csharp
using (var pres = new Presentation())
{
    var slide = pres.Slides[0];
    IAutoShape shape = slide.Shapes.AddMathShape(50, 50, 200, 200);
    IMathParagraph mathParagraph = (shape.TextFrame.Paragraphs[0].Portions[0] as MathPortion).MathParagraph;
    mathParagraph.Add(new MathematicalText("a").Join("+").Join(new MathematicalText("b").Join("=").Join(new MathematicalText("c"))));
    string mathLatex = mathParagraph.ToLatex();
    
    Console.WriteLine(mathLatex);
}
```

The output is:

```
\[
a+b=c
\]
```

## Html5Options.NotesCommentsLayouting ##

Added a new HTML5 export options parameter Html5Options.NotesCommentsLayouting that allows you to convert a presentation with comments .

Example:

``` charp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation("test.pptx"))
{
    pres.Save("index.html", SaveFormat.Html5, new Html5Options()
    {
        OutputPath = "test_pptx",
        NotesCommentsLayouting = new NotesCommentsLayoutingOptions()
            { NotesPosition = NotesPositions.BottomTruncated }
    });
}
```
