## Public API Changes ##

### Modern Comments are now supported ###

We implemented support for PowerPoint **Modern Comments**.

For modern comments, we added the [ModernComment](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/moderncomment) class. We added the [AddModernComment](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/commentcollection/methods/addmoderncomment) and [InsertModernComment](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/commentcollection/methods/insertmoderncomment) methods to [CommentCollection](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/commentcollection). Using these methods, you can add a modern comment to a slide.

This code snippet demonstrates the addition of a modern comment to a slide:

``` csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
     ICommentAuthor newAuthor = pres.CommentAuthors.AddAuthor("Some Author", "SA");
     IModernComment modernComment = newAuthor.Comments.AddModernComment("This is a modern comment", pres.Slides[0], null, new PointF(100, 100), DateTime.Now);
 
     pres.Save("pres.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
```

### Obsolete enumeration SlideOrienation has been removed ###

Obsolete enumeration `SlideOrienation` has been removed. Use the [SlideOrientation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/slideorientation) enumeration instead.

### IMathElement.GetChildren has been added ###

[GetChildren](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.mathtext/imathelement/methods/getchildren) method has been added to the [IMathElement](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.mathtext/imathelement) interface.

Method declaration:

``` csharp
/// <summary>
/// Get children elements
/// </summary>
/// <returns></returns>
IMathElement[] GetChildren();
```

Usage example:

``` csharp
private static void ForEachMathElement(IMathElement root)
{
    foreach (IMathElement child in root.GetChildren())
    {
        //do some action with child
        //...

        //recursive
        // ForEachMathElem(child);

    }
}
```
