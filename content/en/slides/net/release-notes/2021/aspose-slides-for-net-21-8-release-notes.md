* .NETFramework 3.5 (+ClientProfile)
* .NETFramework 4.0 (+ClientProfile)
* .NETStandard 2.0
* .NETStandard 2.1
* .NET 5
* MonoAndroid 9.0

### Support for exporting or converting presentations to animated GIF  ###

We implemented support for converting [presentations](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) to animated GIF export. Using this new functionality, you can export a [presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides/presentation) into an animated GIF with slides changes and even animated transitions:

``` csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation("pres.pptx"))
{
    pres.Save("pres.gif", SaveFormat.Gif, new GifOptions
    {
        FrameSize = new Size(180, 135), // the size of the resulted GIF  
        DefaultDelay = 2500, // how long each slide will be showed until it will be changed to the next one
        TransitionFps = 12 // increase FPS to better transition animation quality
    });
}
```

Export result:

![animated GIF](pres.gif)

### IChartDataWorkbook.CalculateFormulas and ChartDataWorkbook.CalculateFormulas methods have been added ###

[IChartDataWorkbook.CalulateFormulas](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.charts/ichartdataworkbook/methods/calculateformulas) and [ChartDataWorkbook.CalulateFormulas](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/aspose.slides.charts/chartdataworkbook/methods/calculateformulas) methods have been added. With these methods, you can perform calculations with explicit formulas within a workbook. The operation is executed in two steps:

- **Check for unsupported formulas within the entire workbook:** If unsupported formulas are found, CellUnsupportedDataException will be thrown—and values will not be updated. 
- **Formula calculations and updating:** If unsupported formulas are not found, the formulas will be calculated for the workbook—and cells values will be updated.

Cells and their formulas **no** longer reset when new values are set. Values too are **no** longer recalculated when new formulas are set.
