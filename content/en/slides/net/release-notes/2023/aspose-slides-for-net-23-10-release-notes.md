## Public API Changes ##

## TiffOptions.BwConversionMode property and BlackWhiteConversionMode enum added ##

The new `TiffOptions.BwConversionMode` property allows you to specify the algorithm for converting a color image to a black and white image. This setting is applied only when  `CompressionType` is set to `TiffCompressionTypes.CCITT4` or `TiffCompressionTypes.CCITT3`.

Example:

``` csharp
TiffOptions tiffOptions = new TiffOptions();
tiffOptions.CompressionType = TiffCompressionTypes.CCITT4;
tiffOptions.BwConversionMode = BlackWhiteConversionMode.Dithering;

using (var presentation = new Presentation())
{
    presentation.Save(tiffFilePath, SaveFormat.Tiff, tiffOptions);
}
```

## InkBrush and InkTrace classes have been added ##

New classes related to Ink management API have been added:
- `InkTrace` represents a trace element that is used to record the data captured by the digitizer. It contains a sequence of points.
- `InkBrush` represents trace brush.

Example:

``` csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation("pres.pptx"))
{
    IInk ink = (IInk)pres.Slides[0].Shapes[0];
    IInkTrace[] traces = ink.Traces;
    IInkBrush brush = traces[0].Brush;
}
```

## Paragraph.GetLinesCount method has been added ##

The new `GetLinesCount` method of the `Paragraph` class allows you to get the number of lines in a paragraph.

Example:

``` csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    ISlide sld = pres.Slides[0];
    IAutoShape ashp = sld.Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 150, 75, 150, 50);
    IParagraph para = ashp.TextFrame.Paragraphs[0];
    IPortion portion = para.Portions[0];
    portion.Text = "Aspose Paragraph GetLinesCount() Example";
    Console.WriteLine("Lines Count = {0}", para.GetLinesCount());
}
```
