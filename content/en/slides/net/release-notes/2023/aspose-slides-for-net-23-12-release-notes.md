## Public API Changes ##

## Handout Presentation export layout mode added ##

A new Handout presentation export layout mode was added. It represents the corresponding PowerPoint "Print as Handouts" feature. An enumeration HandoutType represents the possible handout types:
- One slide per page
- Two slides per page
- Three slides per page
- Four slides per page in a horizontal sequence
- Four slides per page in a vertical sequence
- Six slides per page in a horizontal sequence
- Six slides per page in a vertical sequence
- Nine slides per page in a horizontal sequence
- Nine slides per page in a vertical sequence

Below is an example of rendering of a presentation in the Handout layout:

``` csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation("pres.pptx"))
{
    RenderingOptions options = new RenderingOptions
    {
        SlidesLayoutOptions = new HandoutLayoutingOptions
        {
            Handout = HandoutType.Handouts4Horizontal,
            PrintSlideNumbers = false
        }
    };
    
    Bitmap[] handoutSlides = pres.GetThumbnails(options);
    for (var index = 0; index < handoutSlides.Length; index++)
    {
        var handoutSllide = handoutSlides[index];
        handoutSllide.Save($"handout-{index}.png");
    }
}
```

To export presentation in the Handout layout to PDF:

```
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation("pres.pptx"))
{
    PdfOptions options = new PdfOptions
    {
        SlidesLayoutOptions = new HandoutLayoutingOptions
        {
            Handout = HandoutType.Handouts4Horizontal
        }
    };
    
    pres.Save("pres.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf, options);
}
```

## NotesCommentsLayouting is obsolete for RenderingOptions, HtmlOtions, PdfOptions, TiffOptions ##

NotesCommentsLayouting property declared as obsolete for RenderingOptions, HtmlOtions, PdfOptions, TiffOptions. The property will be removed after the release of version 24.3.

Please use SlidesLayoutOptions property instead:

```
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation("pres.pptx"))
{
    PdfOptions options = new PdfOptions
    {
        SlidesLayoutOptions = new NotesCommentsLayoutingOptions
        {
            NotesPosition = NotesPositions.BottomTruncated
        }
    };

    pres.Save("pres.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf, options);
}
```

## InkOptions class has been added ##

InkOptions and the corresponding IInkOptions interface has been added. It provides options that control the look of Ink objects in exported documents. 

InkOptions.HideInk allows to show or hides Ink elements in exported document.
InkOptions.InterpretMaskOpAsOpacity can be used to set ROP operation or Opacity for rendering brush.
InkOptions.InterpretMaskOpAsOpacity indicates if it Uses ROP operation or Opacity for rendering brush.

Example:

``` csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation("pres.pptx"))
{
    PdfOptions options = new PdfOptions();
    options.InkOptions.HideInk = true;

    pres.Save("pres.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf, options);
}
```

## IPictureFillFormat.DeletePictureCroppedAreas method has been added ##

IPictureFillFormat.DeletePictureCroppedAreas method allows the cropped areas of the fill Picture:

``` csharp
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation("demo.pptx"))
{
    ISlide slide = presentation.Slides[0];
 
    // Gets the PictureFrame
    IPictureFrame picFrame = slide.Shapes[0] as IPictureFrame;
 
    // Deletes cropped areas of the PictureFrame image
    IPPImage croppedImage = picFrame.PictureFormat.DeletePictureCroppedAreas();
}
```

This can help to reduce the size of the presentation.

## Shape.IsDecorative property has been added ##

The new Shape.IsDecorative property allows to set if the shape is "decorative" (used for decorative purposes, for example, some stylistic objects).

Example:

``` csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation("sample.pptx"))
{
    pres.Slides[0].Shapes[0].IsDecorative = true;
}
```
