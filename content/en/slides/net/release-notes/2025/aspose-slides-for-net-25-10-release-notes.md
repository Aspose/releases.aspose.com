## Updates to Supported Target Platforms

As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance the quality and security of our product, we are planning to discontinue support for outdated versions of the .NET Framework, such as **.NET Framework 2.0**, **3.5**, and **4.0**. These will be replaced with assemblies targeting more modern and secure versions of the .NET platform.  

These changes are scheduled to take effect starting with version **25.11**.  
We recommend updating your projects in advance to ensure compatibility with the supported .NET versions.  
  
For more details about the updates to supported target platforms, please refer to [this article](https://docs.aspose.com/slides/net/net2-obsolete/).  

## Public API Changes

### Added New Enumeration: Aspose.Slides.FontStyleType

The `FontStyleType` enumeration specifies formatting styles that can be applied to text. 
It is introduced in the API as a replacement for `System.Drawing.FontStyle`.

```csharp
[Flags]
public enum FontStyleType
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Standard text.
    /// </summary>
    Regular = 0,
    /// <summary>
    /// Bold text.
    /// </summary>
    Bold = 1,
    /// <summary>
    /// Italic text.
    /// </summary>
    Italic = 2,
    /// <summary>
    /// Underlined text.
    /// </summary>
    Underline = 4,
    /// <summary>
    /// Text crossed out with a horizontal line.
    /// </summary>
    Strikeout = 8,
}
```

### Added New Method: GetFontBytes(IFontData fontData, FontStyleType fontStyle)
The new method, `GetFontBytes`, have been added to the `Aspose.Slides.IFontsManager` interface and implemented in the `Aspose.Slides.FontsManager` class. 
It replaces the obsolete method that used `System.Drawing.FontStyle` as a parameter type.

### Added New Method: Add(string path, IFontData fontData, FontStyleType fontStyle)
The new method, `Add`, have been added to the `Aspose.Slides.Export.Web.Output` class. 
It replaces the obsolete method that used `System.Drawing.FontStyle` as a parameter type.

### Added New Method: Bitmap(float scale, Slides.ImageFormat imageFormat)
The new method, `Bitmap`, have been added to the `Aspose.Slides.Export.SlideImageFormat` class. 
It replaces the obsolete method that used `System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat` as a parameter type.

### Marked as Obsolete
The following methods have been marked as obsolete:

- `Aspose.Slides.IFontsManager.GetFontBytes(IFontData fontData, FontStyle fontStyle)`
- `Aspose.Slides.Export.Web.Output.Add(string path, IFontData fontData, FontStyle fontStyle)`
- `Aspose.Slides.Export.SlideImageFormat.Bitmap(float scale, ImageFormat imgFormat)`
