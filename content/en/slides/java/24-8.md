# What's new in the Aspose.Slides for Java 24.8

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Slides for Java 24.8 introduces significant enhancements for font handling and shape fill customization. With this release, developers can now extract font binary content, analyze font embedding levels, and fully control tile-based picture fills in shapes and slide backgrounds. In addition, it resolves several critical issues related to chart rendering, slide cloning, and image exports.

## New Features

- **Tile Fill Settings for Shapes and Backgrounds:**
  Added new `IPictureFillFormat` properties: `TileOffsetX`, `TileOffsetY`, `TileScaleX`, `TileScaleY`, `TileAlignment`, and `TileFlip`. These enable precise control over tiled texture fills in shapes and slide backgrounds.

- **Font Binary Retrieval:**
  New method `IFontsManager.getFontBytes()` allows direct access to the binary content of fonts used in a presentation.

- **Font Embedding Level Inspection:**
  Retrieve the font embedding permissions using `IFontsManager.getFontEmbeddingLevel()`, identifying installable, editable, restricted, or preview-only embedding rights.

## Enhancements

- **Improved MathML Export:**
  Fixed issues with font size and color loss when exporting math equations via `writeAsMathMl`.

- **Support for Summary Zoom in PDFs:**
  Enhances PDF exports to maintain functionality for summary zoom features.

- **Comments in HTML5:**
  Added ability to display comments during HTML5 export for better presentation review fidelity.

## Bug Fixes

- **Memory and Conversion Fixes:**
  - Resolved `OutOfMemoryError` during large PPTX to PDF conversions.
  - Fixed rendering of charts and background gradients during image and PDF export.

- **Chart and Cloning Issues:**
  - Corrected truncated charts when cloning slides.
  - Restored hidden chart data visibility issues after workbook rewrites.

- **General Stability:**
  - Fixed `NullPointerException` on loading certain PPT files.
  - Resolved discrepancies in axis labels and marker rendering in chart-to-PDF conversions.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New APIs:**
  - `TileOffsetX`, `TileOffsetY`, `TileScaleX`, `TileScaleY`, `TileAlignment`, `TileFlip` in `IPictureFillFormat`
  - `IFontsManager.getFontBytes()` for binary font extraction
  - `IFontsManager.getFontEmbeddingLevel()` for font license compliance
