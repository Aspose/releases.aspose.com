## **Public API Changes**
#### **Methods setShowMasterShapes() and getShowMasterShapes() have been added to IBaseSlide interface and BaseSlide class**
Methods setShowMasterShapes() and getShowMasterShapes() have been added to interface com.aspose.slides.IBaseSlides and to class com.aspose.slides.BaseSlide. They specify if shapes on master slide should be shown on slides (ISlide, ILayoutSlide or INotesLides) or not. For master slide it is impossible to set 'true'.
#### **New method ISlide.reset() has been added**
public void reset() method has been added to ISlide interface and Slide class.

It mimics slide 'Reset' functionality in PowerPoint. The method resets position, size and formatting of every shape that has a prototype on LayoutSlide. Also, it recovers deleted placeholders.
