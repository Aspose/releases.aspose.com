**[IInk](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/IInk)** declaration:

```java
/**
 * <p>
 * Represents an ink object on a slide.
 * </p>
 */
public interface IInk extends IGraphicalObject
{
}
```

### PDF Import
PDF Import feature has been added. This feature allows importing a PDF document into **[Presentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/Presentation)**. A new **[SlideCollection.addFromPdf()](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/com.aspose.slides/SlideCollection#addFromPdf-java.lang.String-)** method creates slides from the PDF document and adds them to the end of the collection:

```java
Presentation pres = new Presentation();
try {
    pres.getSlides().addFromPdf("document.pdf");
    pres.save("presentation.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
} finally {
    if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
```
