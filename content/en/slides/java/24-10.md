# What's new in the Aspose.Slides for Java 24.10

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Slides for Java 24.10 introduces support for vanishing point control in Zoom animations using new `EffectSubtype` values. This release enhances animation customization and ensures improved stability and accuracy across image rendering, PDF exports, and chart processing.

## New Features

- **Vanishing Point Options for Faded Zoom Animation:**
  Added `EffectSubtype.SlideCenter` and `EffectSubtype.ObjectCenter` to define the origin of Zoom animation for shapes, enhancing animation clarity and layout precision.

## Enhancements

- **Improved Animation Inspection:**
  Developers can now extract and manage Zoom animation subtypes directly, improving debugging and animation control within presentations.

## Bug Fixes

- **Chart Rendering Stability:**
  Fixed issues where doughnut charts, waterfall charts, and general charts appeared corrupted or misaligned in PDF and image exports.

- **EMF and Vertical Text Handling:**
  Resolved problems where EMF images with vertical text appeared rotated incorrectly in PDF output.

- **Shape Size and Layout Calculation:**
  Eliminated exceptions triggered during shape size calculations.

- **Hanging and Performance Issues:**
  Addressed scenarios where saving presentations or exporting to PNG would hang or output misaligned data.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Added:**
  - `EffectSubtype.SlideCenter`
  - `EffectSubtype.ObjectCenter`  
  These are usable with `EffectType.FadedZoom` to control animation's vanishing point.
