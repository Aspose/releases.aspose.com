# What's new in the Aspose.Slides for Java 24.5

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Slides for Java 24.5 enhances visual customization and rendering performance with the introduction of table transparency settings and expanded Modern API support. This release also resolves critical export and formatting issues across HTML, PDF, PPTX, and ODP conversions.

## New Features

- **Table and Cell Transparency Support:**
  New `getTransparency()` and `setTransparency()` methods for `ITableFormat` and `ICellFormat` allow setting transparency levels for tables and cells to improve visual layering in slides.

## Enhancements

- **Modern API Transition Updates:**
  The return type of the `getFrame()` method in `IPresentationAnimationPlayer` and `FrameTickEventArgs` has been updated from `BufferedImage` to `IImage`, continuing the transition away from AWT-based image handling.

## Bug Fixes

- **Chart and Data Label Fixes:**
  Resolved issues with data label formatting and black text after saving to PPTX. Fixed horizontal line artifacts in chart images.

- **Export Stability Improvements:**
  Addressed memory usage problems and long processing times during conversions to HTML and PDF formats. Fixed issues with Chinese character rotation, date format changes, and background color retention in exported files.

- **ODP Export Improvements:**
  Fixed problems with slide background application and key not found exceptions when converting from PPTX to ODP format.

- **Animation and Rendering Issues:**
  Resolved blank image generation and rendering inconsistencies across different output formats including PDF, HTML5, and images.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Deprecated:**
  - `ShapeElement.getGraphicsPath()`
  - `ShapeUtil.graphicsPathToGeometryPath()`
  - `ShapeUtil.geometryPathToGraphicsPath()`

- **Updated Return Types:**
  - `IPresentationAnimationPlayer.getFrame()`: returns `IImage`
  - `FrameTickEventArgs.getFrame()`: returns `IImage`

- **New Properties:**
  - `ICellFormat.getTransparency()`, `setTransparency()`
  - `ITableFormat.getTransparency()`, `setTransparency()`
