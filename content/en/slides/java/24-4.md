## Release Highlights

Aspose.Slides for Java 24.4 introduces major new features and upgrades including support for exporting presentations to PowerPoint XML format, detecting macro password protection, and enabling Zip64 compression. A new Modern API is introduced, providing replacements for deprecated Java AWT-based image handling methods.

## New Features
