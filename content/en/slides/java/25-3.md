# What's new in the Aspose.Slides for Java 25.3

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Slides for Java 25.3 introduces powerful features including the ability to manage closed captions in videos, filter out JavaScript links when exporting, and extract column-based text from text frames. Developers can now also set JPEG export quality and disable font ligatures in HTML5 output, enhancing both performance and security of presentation exports.

## New Features

- **VideoFrame Caption Tracks Support:**
  Add, extract, and remove WebVTT-based captions for embedded videos using the new `ICaptionsCollection` and `ICaptions` APIs.

- **Text Column Extraction:**
  Easily retrieve text based on column layout with the new `ITextFrame.splitTextByColumns()` method.

- **JavaScript Link Filtering:**
  Prevent JavaScript-based hyperlinks from being included in HTML, HTML5, or PDF exports using `SkipJavaScriptLinks`.

- **Font Ligatures Control in HTML5:**
  Use `DisableFontLigatures` in `IHtml5Options` for precise control over text rendering behavior.

- **JPEG Quality Control for IImage:**
  The `IImage.save()` method now supports a `quality` parameter for fine-tuning JPEG output.

## Enhancements

- **Improved Multithreading for Image Generation:**
  `getThumbnail()` now handles concurrent access better, improving rendering stability in multi-threaded environments.

- **Optimized Performance for Metered Licenses:**
  PDF conversion with metered keys now executes faster, reducing processing time for large files.

## Bug Fixes

- **Improved Accuracy in PDF Exports:**
  Fixed issues with chart rendering, axis value distortion, and layout consistency during PPTX to PDF conversion.

- **ODP Conversion Stability:**
  Resolved table layout and shape visibility issues when converting from ODP to PPTX.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Interfaces & Properties:**
  - `ICaptions`, `ICaptionsCollection`, `IVideoFrame.getCaptionTracks()`
  - `IHtml5Options.setDisableFontLigatures()`
  - `ISaveOptions.setSkipJavaScriptLinks()`
  - `ITextFrame.splitTextByColumns()`
  - `IImage.save(String filename, ImageFormat format, int quality)`
  - `IImage.save(OutputStream stream, ImageFormat format, int quality)`
