# What's new in the Aspose.Slides for Java 24.7

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Slides for Java 24.7 introduces powerful features for managing presentation content and enhancing export functionality. This release adds support for embedding OLE objects in PDFs, placing chart placeholders on layout slides, and securely loading presentations by stripping binary data such as embedded ActiveX or VBA code.

## New Features

- **Embed Files in Exported PDF Documents:**
  A new `PdfOptions.IncludeOleData` property allows exporting presentations to PDF with embedded OLE files for complete data preservation.

- **Add Placeholders to Layout Slides:**
  Using the new `ILayoutPlaceholderManager` API, developers can now programmatically insert various placeholders (e.g., chart, table, media) on layout slides for templating.

- **Secure Load with Binary Cleanup:**
  `LoadOptions.DeleteEmbeddedBinaryObjects` enables stripping potentially unsafe content (VBA, OLE, ActiveX) during presentation loading to prevent malicious payloads.

## Enhancements

- **Improved Password-Protected File Handling:**
  Enhanced support for password-protected or corrupted PPT/PPTX files, reducing errors and exceptions when opening them.

- **Better Comment Slide Numbering:**
  Slide numbering logic now correctly excludes comment pages from the count in exported PDF documents.

## Bug Fixes

- **Chart Rendering and Labeling Fixes:**
  Resolved several issues related to missing or cropped charts, bar label formatting, and incorrect chart rendering in PDF/JPG outputs.

- **Export and Parsing Errors:**
  - Addressed `NullPointerException` when converting notes to HTML.
  - Fixed `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` in PPT to HTML5 conversions.
  - Restored missing content and corrected encoding for embedded data exports.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New APIs:**
  - `ILayoutPlaceholderManager` and `ILayoutSlide.PlaceholderManager` for layout placeholder manipulation.
  - `LoadOptions.DeleteEmbeddedBinaryObjects` to clean presentations on load.
  - `PdfOptions.IncludeOleData` to embed files in PDF output.
