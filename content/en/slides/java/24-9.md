# What's new in the Aspose.Slides for Java 24.9

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Slides for Java 24.9 introduces powerful presentation optimization and text extraction features. It now enables compression of images based on DPI and cropped area removal, similar to PowerPoint’s Compress Pictures tool. Additionally, comments and notes can now be extracted via the `PresentationFactory`, enhancing support for full-text content processing.

## New Features

- **DPI-Based Image Compression:**
  A new method `compressImage()` in `IPictureFillFormat` lets you reduce image size based on slide shape and resolution, including options to remove cropped areas.

- **Extract Comments and Notes via `PresentationFactory`:**
  The new `ISlideText.getCommentsText()` property enables retrieval of comments using `PresentationFactory.getPresentationText()` in `Unarranged` mode, aiding better analysis and automation of feedback content.

- **EffectType Enum Extended:**
  New alias values `FloatUp` and `FloatDown` added as synonyms for `Ascend` and `Descend` respectively for better semantic clarity in animation scripting.

## Enhancements

- **Improved Text Extraction Coverage:**
  Notes and comments are now correctly included in extracted content through enhanced `GetPresentationText()` support.

- **Deprecated API Cleanup:**
  Removed the legacy `addVideo(InputStream stream)` method in favor of the stream-handling overload with controlled loading behavior.

## Bug Fixes

- **Chart and PDF Stability Fixes:**
  - Resolved exceptions like `PptxReadException` and `OutOfMemoryError` while processing PPTX files with charts.
  - Fixed chart data tables and line breaks rendering incorrectly in PDF exports.

- **Image Rendering Corrections:**
  Fixed issues where chart lines and markers were distorted in exported slide images.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **Added:**
  - `IPictureFillFormat.compressImage(boolean removeCroppedAreas, float dpi)`
  - `ISlideText.getCommentsText()`
  - `EffectType.FloatUp` and `EffectType.FloatDown`

- **Removed:**
  - `IVideoCollection.addVideo(InputStream stream)`
