# What's new in the Aspose.Slides for Java 25.1

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Slides for Java 25.1 introduces powerful features for presentation processing, including support for extended metadata extraction, SVG to EMF conversion, EMF slide export, and flexible thumbnail control when saving PPTX files. This release significantly improves PDF rendering, memory efficiency, and visual consistency in exported outputs.

## New Features

- **Import Embedded Fonts from PDF:**
  Enables seamless presentation font compatibility when importing PDFs.

- **Extended Metadata Access:**
  Retrieve detailed properties such as slide counts, hidden slides, notes, media clips, word and paragraph counts, and grouped document part info.

- **Disable Thumbnail Generation on Save:**
  Added `RefreshThumbnail` option in `PptxOptions` to skip thumbnail regeneration for performance tuning.

- **Permanent SVG to EMF Conversion:**
  Convert SVG images into EMF format via `SvgImage.writeAsEmf()` for higher compatibility and fidelity.

- **Slide-to-Metafile Export:**
  Save any slide as an EMF using `Slide.writeAsEmf()`—ideal for vector-based archiving and printing.

## Enhancements

- **Document Corruption Detection:**
  Determine if presentation files are corrupted using `IPresentationInfo`.

- **Enhanced Image Compression:**
  New overload for `CompressImage()` lets users apply standard DPI presets (e.g., 150 DPI) while removing cropped areas.

## Bug Fixes

- **PDF Export Stability:**
  - Fixed OutOfMemory errors in complex PPTX-to-PDF conversions.
  - Corrected red text rendering in slide-to-image exports.
  - Addressed hangs when exporting large files to PDF.

- **SVG to EMF Fix:**
  - Dashed borders now correctly preserved in converted EMF images.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Interfaces and Properties:**
  - `IHeadingPair`, `IDocumentProperties`, and `IPresentationInfo` provide rich metadata inspection and control.
  - `RefreshThumbnail` added to `PptxOptions` for thumbnail generation control.
  - `CompressImage()` enhanced with `PicturesCompression` enum for resolution targeting.
  - `ISlide.writeAsEmf()` and `ISvgImage.writeAsEmf()` for metafile generation.
