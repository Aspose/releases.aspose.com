### Convert Math Equations to LaTeX

A powerful new feature allows developers to seamlessly convert math equations to LaTeX format within their C++ PowerPoint presentation processing apps on Windows.

### Display Slide Notes in Generated HTML5 Documents

Using Aspose.Slides for C++ 24.2, you can export presentations with comprehensive notes for reviewers and collaborators. With the inclusion of slide notes within generated HTML5 documents, you can improve collaboration efficiency.

### Enhanced Error Handling for Corrupted PPTX Files

We have improved the robustness of the C++ API to ensure a smoother user experience. It now gracefully handles corrupted PPTX files, preventing exceptions and providing informative error messages for troubleshooting.

### Improved OLE Object Handling

The OLE objects handling in PowerPoint presentations has been refined in this update. The visual fidelity of the exported presentations is enhanced with the accurate display of the preview image of the OLE objects.

### Bug Fixes and Enhancements

Various issues are resolved, and enhancements are incorporated, such as the ability to save presentations to PPTX format after removing write protection and more.

### Learn to Convert Math Equations to LaTex in C++

The following code sample showcases how to convert math equations within a PowerPoint presentation to LaTex format using the `IMathParagraph::ToLatex()` method:

```C++
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>();

System::SharedPtr<ISlide> slide = pres->get_Slide(0);
System::SharedPtr<IAutoShape> shape = slide->get_Shapes()->AddMathShape(50.0f, 50.0f, 200.0f, 200.0f);
System::SharedPtr<IMathPortion> mathPortion = System::AsCast<Aspose::Slides::MathText::IMathPortion>(
    shape->get_TextFrame()->get_Paragraph(0)->get_Portion(0));
System::SharedPtr<IMathParagraph> mathParagraph = mathPortion->get_MathParagraph();
mathParagraph->Add(System::MakeObject<MathematicalText>(u"a")->
    Join(u"+")->
    Join(System::MakeObject<MathematicalText>(u"b")->
        Join(u"=")->
        Join(System::MakeObject<MathematicalText>(u"c"))));
System::String mathLatex = mathParagraph->ToLatex();

System::Console::WriteLine(mathLatex);


```

### Setup Presentation Conversions with Comments

This sample code highlights how you can configure presentation conversions with comments added in Aspose.Slides for C++ 24.2 using the newly introduced `IHtml5Options::set_NotesCommentsLayouting()` method:

```C++
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>(u"test.pptx");

auto html5Options = System::MakeObject<Html5Options>();
html5Options->set_OutputPath(u"test_pptx");

auto notesCommentsLayouting = System::MakeObject<NotesCommentsLayoutingOptions>();
notesCommentsLayouting->set_NotesPosition(Aspose::Slides::Export::NotesPositions::BottomTruncated);
html5Options->set_NotesCommentsLayouting(notesCommentsLayouting);

pres->Save(u"index.html", Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Html5, html5Options);

```
