#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Slides for C++ 25.4 for Linux refines presentation rendering with enhanced thumbnail generation, better geometry analysis of shapes, and support for column-based text extraction. These improvements benefit both export fidelity and content accessibility.

#### New Features and Enhancements

- **Improved Shape Rendering**:
  - Higher-quality thumbnails from individual shapes and enhanced conversion outputs.

- **Access to Shape Adjustment Points**:
  - Use `get_Type()` to analyze or adjust shape properties such as angles, corner radius, and curvature.

- **Extract Text by Columns**:
  - Access individual column content from `TextFrame` objects.

- **Text Wrapping Fix in EMF-to-PDF**:
  - Ensures text in EMF images wraps correctly when exported to PDF.
