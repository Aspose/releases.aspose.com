#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Slides for C++ 25.1 for Windows delivers an advanced set of features for presentation management, including embedded font import from PDFs, Office metadata extraction, metafile export, and enhanced control over PPTX save behavior. This release empowers developers with high-precision tools for enterprise-grade PowerPoint handling.
