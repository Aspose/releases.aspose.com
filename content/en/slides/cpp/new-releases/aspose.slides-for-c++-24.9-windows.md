#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Slides for C++ 24.9 for Windows introduces key features including advanced image compression, support for extracting comments and notes via `PresentationFactory`, and enhanced animation effect recognition. It also removes outdated API methods to streamline development workflows.

#### New Features and Enhancements

- **Presentation Text from Notes & Comments**: Enhanced `PresentationFactory::GetPresentationText()` now supports extracting notes and comments.
- **Image Compression Support**: `IPictureFillFormat::CompressImage()` reduces image size based on shape dimensions and resolution, similar to PowerPointâ€™s compression.
- **Custom DPI and Crop Area Removal**: Remove cropped image regions and set desired resolution to optimize output.
- **EffectType Enum Updates**: New aliases `FloatUp` and `FloatDown` added for `Ascend` and `Descend` animation effects respectively.
- **Comment Text API**: New `ISlideText::get_CommentsText()` method retrieves comment-specific text in slides.
- **Obsolete API Removal**: Deprecated `IVideoCollection::AddVideo(Stream)` method has been officially removed.
