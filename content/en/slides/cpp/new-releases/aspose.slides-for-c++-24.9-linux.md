#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Slides for C++ 24.9 for Linux aligns with the Windows edition, delivering comment extraction, DPI-based image compression, and improved animation effect handling. It supports development using Clang 3.9+, GCC 6.1+, and glibc 2.23+.

#### New Features and Enhancements

- **Extract Notes & Comments**: Retrieve slide notes and comments text using `PresentationFactory::GetPresentationText()`.
- **Image Optimization Tools**: Reduce image sizes using `IPictureFillFormat::CompressImage()` with custom DPI and optional cropped area removal.
- **New EffectType Enum Aliases**: Includes `FloatUp`/`FloatDown` for improved animation compatibility.
- **Public API Clean-Up**: Deprecated video stream API removed for better clarity and modern API alignment.
- **Comment Extraction Support**: Access comment-specific content using `ISlideText::get_CommentsText()`.
