### Control Table Transparency in macOS

Supercharge presentations on macOS using Aspose.Slides for C++ 24.5 with the ability to set table transparency for a more customized look of your PowerPoint presentations.

### Augmented Presentation Rendering

With this C++ API version, you can experience improved rendering results when exporting WMF to PNG and ensuring visually appealing presentations.

### Modern API Updates

macOS developers can now benefit from improved presentation API usability and compatibility with the latest Aspose.Slides for .NET version.

### Handle Shape Transparency

This release's new shape transparency methodsÂ give you greater control over presentation visuals. Develop high-performance presentation processing applications targeting the Linux platform that can get or set fill color transparency.

The following code example illustrates how to set the transparency of the fill color.

```c++

System::SharedPtr<Presentation> presentation = System::MakeObject<Presentation>(u"pres.pptx");
System::SharedPtr<ITable> table = System::ExplicitCast<Aspose::Slides::ITable>(presentation->get_Slide(0)->get_Shape(0));
table->get_TableFormat()->set_Transparency(0.5f);

```
