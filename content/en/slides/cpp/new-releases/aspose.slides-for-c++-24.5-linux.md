### Control Transparency for Tables

Aspose.Slides for C++ 24.5 lets developers boost presentation apps with the ability to set table transparency for a more customized look of your PowerPoint presentations on Linux OS.

### Optimized Presentation Rendering

Enjoy optimized rendering results when exporting WMF to PNG and ensuring great-looking presentations.

### Modern API Updates

Linux developers can benefit from updated presentation API usability and compatibility with the latest Aspose.Slides for .NET version.

### Shape Transparency Handling

This version of the C++ API delivers finer control over presentation visuals with the introduction of shape transparency methods. Build feature-rich presentation processing applications targeting the Linux platform with the ability to get or set fill color transparency.

The following code example illustrates how to set the transparency of the fill color.

```c++

System::SharedPtr<Presentation> presentation = System::MakeObject<Presentation>(u"pres.pptx");
System::SharedPtr<ITable> table = System::ExplicitCast<Aspose::Slides::ITable>(presentation->get_Slide(0)->get_Shape(0));
table->get_TableFormat()->set_Transparency(0.5f);

```
