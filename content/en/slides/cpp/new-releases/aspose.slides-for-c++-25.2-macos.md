#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Slides for C++ 25.2 for macOS introduces detailed control over audio effects and presentation exports. The update provides new methods for setting trim durations, fades, and volume on audio frames, alongside fine control over ligature behavior and text frame parent tracking.

#### New Features and Enhancements

- **Audio Enhancements**:
  - Apply fade-in/out and trimming effects to embedded audio.
  - Set volume levels per audio frame.

- **Ligature Export Customization**:
  - Choose whether to render font ligatures in SVG, HTML, and image exports.

- **Parent Tracking for TextFrames**:
  - Gain clarity on whether a `TextFrame` belongs to a shape or a cell using new methods.

- **Rendering Fixes**:
  - Merged characters in PNG/HTML exports are now correctly separated.
