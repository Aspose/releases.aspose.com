### Transparency Control for Tables

Aspose.Slides for C++ 24.5 allows developers to enhance presentations with the ability to set table transparency for a more customized look of your PowerPoint presentations on Windows OS.

### Improved Presentation Rendering

Experience better rendering results while exporting WMF to PNG and ensuring accurate presentation creation.

### Modern API Updates

You can now benefit from improved presentation API usability and compatibility with the latest Aspose.Slides for .NET version.

### Shape Transparency API

The latest release of the C++ API offers finer control over presentation visuals with the introduction of shape transparency methods. Build powerful presentation processing applications targeting the Windows platform with the ability to get or set fill color transparency.

The following code example illustrates how to set the transparency of the fill color.

```c++

System::SharedPtr<Presentation> presentation = System::MakeObject<Presentation>(u"pres.pptx");
System::SharedPtr<ITable> table = System::ExplicitCast<Aspose::Slides::ITable>(presentation->get_Slide(0)->get_Shape(0));
table->get_TableFormat()->set_Transparency(0.5f);

```
