#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Slides for C++ 25.4 for Windows delivers visual quality and shape data access enhancements, including precise control over image rendering and the ability to extract structured multi-column text from slides. Developers can now programmatically analyze and modify shape geometry adjustments.

#### New Features and Enhancements

- **Multi-Column Text Extraction**:
  - Retrieve text by columns using enhanced `TextFrame` processing.

- **High-Quality Shape Thumbnails**:
  - Improved rendering fidelity for shape-to-image conversion.

- **Adjustment Point Access**:
  - Access shape geometry controls using `IAdjustValue::get_Type()` to retrieve `ShapeAdjustmentType` (e.g., radius, curvature, angle).

- **Improved EMF to PDF Handling**:
  - Bug fix ensures proper text wrapping when converting EMF to PDF.
