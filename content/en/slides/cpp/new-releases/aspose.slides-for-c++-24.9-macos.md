#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Slides for C++ 24.9 for macOS supports Apple Silicon (ARM64) and Intel (x86_64) architectures. This update empowers macOS developers with precise image control and improved text extraction capabilities including comment and note parsing.

#### New Features and Enhancements

- **Notes & Comments Extraction**: Enhanced `PresentationFactory::GetPresentationText()` now includes slide notes and comments.
- **Efficient Image Compression**: Use `IPictureFillFormat::CompressImage()` to resize images while optionally removing cropped parts.
- **Enum Expansion**: Added `FloatUp` and `FloatDown` aliases to `EffectType` for better animation mapping.
- **API Streamlining**: Legacy video streaming method removed, ensuring a cleaner API.
- **Extract Slide Comments**: New `get_CommentsText()` method allows direct access to slide-level comments for auditing or collaboration use.
