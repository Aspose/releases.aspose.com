A new **[SlideCollection::AddFromPdf](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.slide_collection#a966c00d26b741a6c56e424d2f0d689a5)**
method creates slides from the PDF document and adds them to the end of the collection:

```cpp
auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>();
pres->get_Slides()->AddFromPdf(u"document.pdf");
pres->Save(u"fromPdfDocument.pptx", Aspose::Slides::Export::SaveFormat::Pptx);
```

### IInk interface has been added
**[IInk](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.ink.i_ink)**
interface and Ink implementer class have been added. They represent an **[IInk](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.ink.i_ink)**
graphical element.

**[IInk](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/class/aspose.slides.ink.i_ink)**  declaration:

```cpp
/// <summary>
/// Represents an ink object on a slide.
/// </summary>
class ASPOSE_SLIDES_API_SHARED_CLASS IInk : public virtual Aspose::Slides::IGraphicalObject
{
};
```
