## Apple Silicon M1/M2 Support
We are pleased to announce the release of the ARM64 edition of Aspose.Slides for C++ for macOS, specifically optimized for the innovative Apple Silicon platform. 
This architecture fuels the performance and efficiency of all modern Apple computers, showcasing exceptional capabilities.

Now the Aspose.Slides for C++ macOS package includes 2 libraries:
- `libAspose.Slides_appleclang_x86_64.dylib` - library for x86_64 architecture.
- `libAspose.Slides_appleclang_arm64.dylib` - library for ARM64 architecture.

Using CMake, library selection is fully automatic. You can see an example of this use in the demo project in the sample directory.

## Public API Changes

### Text Animation Effect - AnimateTextType enum has been added

The new [AnimateTextType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/aspose.slides.animation/animatetexttype/) enum class has been added and it represents the animate text type of an animation effect. It allows to set the following text animation types:
- Animate all text at once.
- Animate text by word.
- Animate text by letter.

Example:

``` cpp
System::SharedPtr<Presentation> presentation = System::MakeObject<Presentation>(u"demo.pptx");

// Get the first effect of the first slide.
System::SharedPtr<IEffect> firstSlideEffect = presentation->get_Slide(0)->get_Timeline()->get_MainSequenceEffect(0);

// Change the effect Animate text type to "By letter"
firstSlideEffect->set_AnimateTextType(AnimateTextType::ByLetter);
```
