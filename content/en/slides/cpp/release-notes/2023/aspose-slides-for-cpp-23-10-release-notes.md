## Public API Changes

### TiffOptions::get_BwConversionMode(), TiffOptions::set_BwConversionMode() methods, and BlackWhiteConversionMode enum class have been added

The new methods allows you to specify the algorithm for converting a color image to a black and white image. This setting is applied only when `CompressionType` is set to `TiffCompressionTypes::CCITT4` or `TiffCompressionTypes::CCITT3`.

Example:

``` cpp
System::SharedPtr<TiffOptions> tiffOptions = System::MakeObject<TiffOptions>();
tiffOptions->set_CompressionType(TiffCompressionTypes::CCITT4);
tiffOptions->set_BwConversionMode(BlackWhiteConversionMode::Dithering);

System::SharedPtr<Presentation> presentation = System::MakeObject<Presentation>();
presentation->Save(tiffFilePath, SaveFormat::Tiff, tiffOptions);
```

### InkBrush and InkTrace classes have been added

New classes related to Ink management API have been added: 
- `InkTrace` represents a trace element that is used to record the data captured by the digitizer. It contains a sequence of points.
- `InkBrush` represents trace brush.

Example:

``` cpp
System::SharedPtr<Presentation> pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>(u"pres.pptx");

System::SharedPtr<IInk> ink = System::ExplicitCast<IInk>(pres->get_Slide(0)->get_Shape(0));
System::ArrayPtr<System::SharedPtr<IInkTrace>> traces = ink->get_Traces();
System::SharedPtr<IInkBrush> brush = traces[0]->get_Brush();
```

### Paragraph::GetLinesCount() method has been added

The new `GetLinesCount()` method of the `Paragraph` class allows you to get the number of lines in a paragraph.

Example:

``` cpp
System::SharedPtr<Presentation> pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>();

System::SharedPtr<ISlide> sld = pres->get_Slide(0);
System::SharedPtr<IAutoShape> ashp = sld->get_Shapes()->AddAutoShape(ShapeType::Rectangle, 150.0f, 75.0f, 150.0f, 50.0f);
System::SharedPtr<IParagraph> para = ashp->get_TextFrame()->get_Paragraph(0);
System::SharedPtr<IPortion> portion = para->get_Portion(0);
portion->set_Text(u"Aspose Paragraph GetLinesCount() Example");
System::Console::WriteLine(u"Lines Count = {0}", para->GetLinesCount());
```
