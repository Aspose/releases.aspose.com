## Public API Changes

### ShapeElement and ShapeUtil members declared as obsolete Modern API

The following methods and properties are declared as obsolete and will be removed in version 24.8:
- ShapeElement::get_GraphicsPath()
- ShapeUtil::GraphicsPathToGeometryPath(SharedPtr&lt;GraphicsPath&gt; graphicsPath)
- ShapeUtil::GeometryPathToGraphicsPath(SharedPtr&lt;IGeometryPath&gt; geometryPath)

### IPresentationAnimationPlayer::GetFrame() and FrameTickEventArgs::GetFrame() return value type replaced to IImage

The return type of the GetFrame() method for the IPresentationAnimationPlayer interface and PresentationAnimationPlayer implementation was replaced to IImage from Bitmap. This is required as a part of the Modern API transition.

FrameTickEventArgs::GetFrame() method return value is also replaced from Bitmap to IImage.

### New methods get_Transparency() and set_Transparency() have been added.

The get_Transparency() and set_Transparency() methods have been added to the ICellFormat and ITableFormat interfaces. They specify the transparency of the fill color.

Example:

``` cpp
System::SharedPtr<Presentation> presentation = System::MakeObject<Presentation>(u"pres.pptx");
System::SharedPtr<ITable> table = System::ExplicitCast<Aspose::Slides::ITable>(presentation->get_Slide(0)->get_Shape(0));
table->get_TableFormat()->set_Transparency(0.5f);
```
