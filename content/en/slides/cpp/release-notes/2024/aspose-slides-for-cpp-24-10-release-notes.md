## Public API Changes

### New Enum Members: EffectSubtype::SlideCenter and EffectSubtype::ObjectCenter Have Been Added

New members, `SlideCenter` and `ObjectCenter`, have been added to the `EffectSubtype` enum. These effect subtypes are used with the FadedZoom effect type.
The following example demonstrates how these members can be used:

```cpp
System::SharedPtr<Presentation> presentation = System::MakeObject<Presentation>(u"pres.pptx");
System::SharedPtr<IEffect> effect = presentation->get_Slide(0)->get_Timeline()->get_MainSequenceEffect(0);

if (effect->get_Type() == EffectType::FadedZoom)
{
    System::Console::WriteLine(u"{0} - {1}", effect.Type, effect.Subtype);
}
```
