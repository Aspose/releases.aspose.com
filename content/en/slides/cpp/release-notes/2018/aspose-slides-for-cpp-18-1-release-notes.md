{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

This is the first Aspose.Slides for C++ 18.1 release. Its API is completely new, and it is based on Aspose.Slides for .NET 18.1 API.

Aspose.Slides for C++ 18.1 doesn't support GIF and TIFF image formats. There are known WMF/EMF and SVG restrictions.  These features will be added soon. Slides rendered with .NET and C++ versions can have small differences because different rendering engines are used.
