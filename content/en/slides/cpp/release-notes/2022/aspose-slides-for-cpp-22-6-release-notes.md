### Obsolete PresentationLockingBehavior LoadAndRelease_Legacy_TemporaryDefault was removed ###

The obsolete [PresentationLockingBehavior](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/cpp/namespace/aspose.slides#ad81bf27e76ea7c956dcb53c6efed8cbb) LoadAndRelease_Legacy_TemporaryDefault enum member was removed. LoadAndRelease is a default presentation locking behavior now.
