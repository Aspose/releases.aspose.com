## **Public API Changes**

#### **get_AlternativeTextTitle() and set_AlternativeTextTitle() methods have been added to IShape class**
New get_AlternativeTextTitle() and set_AlternativeTextTitle() methods have been added to IShape and Shape classes.

These methods allow to get or set the title of alternative text associated with a shape.

Sample code demonstrating setting alternative text title:

``` cpp
System::SharedPtr<Presentation> presentation = System::MakeObject<Presentation>();
System::SharedPtr<IAutoShape> shape = presentation->get_Slides()->idx_get(0)->get_Shapes()->AddAutoShape(Aspose::Slides::ShapeType::Rectangle, 100, 50, 300, 150);
shape->set_AlternativeTextTitle(u"Alt text title");
```
