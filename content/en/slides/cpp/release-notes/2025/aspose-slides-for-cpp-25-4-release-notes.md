## Public API Changes

### Added New Method: IAdjustValue::get_Type()

The new method, `get_Type()`, has been added to the `IAdjustValue` interface and implemented in the `AdjustValue` class. This method allows you to get information about the type of shape adjustment.  
The return value is of the `ShapeAdjustmentType` enumeration type and can take the following values:

```csharp
enum class ShapeAdjustmentType
{
    Custom = 0, // Unknown adjustment
    CornerSize, // Controls the size of the corners
    LeftUpCorner, // Controls the up left corner
    RightUpCorner, // Controls the up right corner
    UpCorners, // Controls the upper corners
    DownCorners, // Controls the down corners
    Thickness, // Controls the thickness of the figure
    ArrowTailThickness, // Controls the thickness of the arrow tail
    ArrowheadLength, // Controls the length of the arrowhead
    ArrowheadWidth, // Controls the width of the arrowhead
    Radius, // Controls the size of the radius of the shape or its part
    Depth, // Controls the depth of the gear teeth or the bevel effect
    ShapePartOffset, // Controls the offset of one part of the figure relative to another
    Angle, // Controls the angle for figure or its part
    StartAngle, // Start angle for pie and arc shapes
    EndAngle, // End angle for pie and arc shapes
    StartPointX, // Controls the callout start point X position
    StartPointY, // Controls the callout start point Y position
    ConnectorPoint1X, // Controls the horizontal position of the callout angle adjustment point
    ConnectorPoint1Y, // Controls the vertical position of the callout angle adjustment point
    ConnectorPoint2X, // Controls the horizontal position of the callout angle adjustment point
    ConnectorPoint2Y, // Controls the vertical position of the callout angle adjustment point
    ConnectorBendPositionX, // Controls the horizontal position of the bend in the connector
    ConnectorBendPositionY, // Controls the vertical position of the bend in the connector
    AttachY, // Controls the vertical attachment point of the figure
    AttachX, // Controls the horizontal attachment point of the figure
    CalloutHeight, // Controls the vertical size of the callout
    CalloutWidth, // Controls the horizontal size of the callout
    CalloutSize, // Controls the size of the callout
    Curvature, // Curvature of a bent, braces, curved arrow or shape
    HorizontalThickness, // Controls the horizontal thickness of the corner shape
    VerticalThickness, // Controls the vertical thickness of the corner shape
    VerticalSize, // Controls the vertical size of the shape
    HorizontalSize, // Controls the horizontal size of the shape
    Top // Controls the top side of a shape
}
```
