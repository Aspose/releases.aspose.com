## Public API Changes ##

## TiffOptions.bw_conversion_mode property and BlackWhiteConversionMode enum added ##

The new `TiffOptions.bw_conversion_mode` property allows you to specify the algorithm for converting a color image to a black and white image. This setting is applied only when  `compression_type` is set to `TiffCompressionTypes.CCITT4` or `TiffCompressionTypes.CCITT3`.

Example:

```py
tiff_options = TiffOptions()
tiff_options.compression_type = TiffCompressionTypes.CCITT4
tiff_options.bw_conversion_mode = BlackWhiteConversionMode.DITHERING

with Presentation() as presentation:
    presentation.save(tiff_file_path, SaveFormat.TIFF, tiff_options)
```

## InkBrush and InkTrace classes have been added ##

New classes related to Ink management API have been added:
- `InkTrace` represents a trace element that is used to record the data captured by the digitizer. It contains a sequence of points.
- `InkBrush` represents trace brush.

Example:

```py
with Presentation("pres.pptx") as pres:
    ink = pres.slides[0].shapes[0]
    traces = ink.traces
    brush = traces[0].brush
```

## Paragraph.get_lines_count method has been added ##

The new `get_lines_count` method of the `Paragraph` class allows you to get the number of lines in a paragraph.

Example:

```py
with Presentation() as pres:
    sld = pres.slides[0]
    ashp = sld.shapes.add_auto_shape(ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 150, 75, 150, 50)
    para = ashp.text_frame.paragraphs[0]
    portion = para.portions[0]
    portion.text = "Aspose Paragraph get_lines_count() Example";
    print("Lines Count =", para.get_lines_count())
```
