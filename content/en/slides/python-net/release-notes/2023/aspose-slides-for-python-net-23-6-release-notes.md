## Public API Changes ##

## LoadOptions.default_text_language property have been added ##

`LoadOptions.default_text_language` property has been added. It represents the default language for presentation text.

The example below demonstrates using load options to define the default text culture:

``` python
import aspose.slides as slides
from aspose.slides import LoadOptions as LoadOptions

loadOptions = LoadOptions()
loadOptions.default_text_language = "en-US"
with slides.Presentation(loadOptions) as pres:
    # Add new rectangle shape with text
    shape = pres.slides[0].shapes.add_auto_shape(slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 50, 50, 150, 50)
    shape.text_frame.text = "New Text"
    
    # Check the first portion language
    print(shape.text_frame.paragraphs[0].portions[0].portion_format.language_id)
```
