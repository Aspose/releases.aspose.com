## **Public API Changes**

### `NONE` member have been added to TimeUnitType enumeration ###

A new *NONE* member have been added to [TimeUnitType](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/timeunittype/) enumeration. This member indicates that no unit should be set for the appropriate unit scale.

```py
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation() as pres:
    chart = pres.slides[0].shapes.add_chart(charts.ChartType.AREA, 10, 10, 400, 300, True)
    chart.axes.horizontal_axis.major_unit_scale = charts.TimeUnitType.NONE
    pres.save("chart.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```
