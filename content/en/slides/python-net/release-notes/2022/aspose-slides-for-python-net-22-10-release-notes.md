## Public API Changes ##

## **ISVGOptions.use_frame_size** and **ISVGOptions.use_frame_rotation** have been added ##

New properties [use_frame_size](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.export/isvgoptions/) and [use_frame_rotation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.export/isvgoptions/) have been added to the ISVGOptions interface and SVGOptions class.

The [use_frame_size](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.export/isvgoptions/) property allows determines whether the text frame will be included in a rendering area.

The [use_frame_rotation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.export/isvgoptions/) property allows determines whether to perform the specified rotation of the shape when rendering.

The code snippet below demonstrates using these properties:

``` python
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation("pres.pptx") as pres:
    svgOptions = slides.export.SVGOptions()

    # Does not perform the specified rotation of the shape while rendering to SVG.
    svgOptions.use_frame_rotation = False

    # Include the text frame in a rendering area while rendering to SVG.
    svgOptions.use_frame_size = True

    # Save shape to SVG
    with open("pres-out.svg", "wb") as file:
        pres.slides[0].write_as_svg(file, svgOptions)
```

## Embedded fonts compress feature added ##

Embedded fonts can be compressed to decrease the size of the presentation that contains such fonts. To provide this functionality, the [compress_embedded_fonts](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.lowcode/compress/) method was added to LowCode API.

Below is the snippet demonstrating compression:

``` python
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation("pres.pptx") as pres:

    slides.lowcode.Compress.compress_embedded_fonts(pres)
    pres.save("pres-out.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)

```

## **leader_lines_color** porperty has been added ##

The [leader_lines_color](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.charts/idatalabelcollection/) property has been addded, now the color of all leader lines in the collection can be managed via this property:

``` python
import aspose.slides as slides
import aspose.pydrawing as drawing

with slides.Presentation("pres.pptx") as pres:
    chart = pres.slides[0].shapes[0]
    series = chart.chart_data.series
    labels = series[0].labels
    
    labels.leader_lines_color = drawing.Color.from_argb(255, 255, 0, 0)
```
