## Public API Changes

### PDF import detect tables option added

The `PdfImportOptions.detect_tables` option has been added to ensure that when importing PDF tables are automatically detected and imported as a table in `Slide`.

Below is an example of PDF import with tables detecting:

``` python
import aspose.slides as slides
import aspose.pyio as io

with slides.Presentation() as pres, open("document.pdf", "rb") as stream:
    pdf_import_options = slides.importing.PdfImportOptions()
    pdf_import_options.detect_tables = True
    pres.slides.add_from_pdf(stream, pdf_import_options)
    pres.save("fromPdfDocument.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```
