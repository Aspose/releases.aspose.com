## Public API Changes

### ShapeElement and ShapeUtil members declared as obsolete Modern API ##

The following methods and properties are declared as obsolete and will be removed in version 24.8:
- [`ShapeElement.graphics_path`](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/shapeelement/graphics_path/)
- [`ShapeUtil.graphics_path_to_geometry_path`](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.util/shapeutil/graphics_path_to_geometry_path/#asposepydrawingdrawing2dgraphicspath)
- [`ShapeUtil.geometry_path_to_graphics_path`](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.util/shapeutil/geometry_path_to_graphics_path/#igeometrypath)

### `EnumerableFrameArgs.get_frame()` return value type replaced to `IImage`

The return type of the [`get_frame`](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.export/enumerableframeargs/get_frame/#) method for the [`EnumerableFrameArgs`](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.export/enumerableframeargs/) class was replaced to [`IImage`](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/iimage/) from `Bitmap`. This is required as a part of the Modern API transition.

### `ICellFormat.transparency` and `ITableFormat.transparency` properties added

New property `transparency` added to the [`ICellFormat`](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/icellformat/) and [`ITableFormat`](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides/itableformat/). It represents the transparency of the fill color.

Example:

```python
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation("pres.pptx") as presentation:
    table = presentation.slides[0].shapes[0]
    table.table_format.transparency = 0.5
```
