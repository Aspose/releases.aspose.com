## Public API Changes

### New Enum Members: EffectSubtype.SLIDE_CENTER and EffectSubtype.OBJECT_CENTER Have Been Added

New members, `SLIDE_CENTER` and `OBJECT_CENTER`, have been added to the `EffectSubtype` enum. These effect subtypes are used with the FadedZoom effect type.
The following example demonstrates how these members can be used:

```python
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation("pres.pptx") as presentation:
    effect = presentation.slides[0].timeline.main_sequence[0]
	if effect.type == slides.EffectType.FADED_ZOOM:
	    print(f"{effect.type} - {effect.subtype}")
```
