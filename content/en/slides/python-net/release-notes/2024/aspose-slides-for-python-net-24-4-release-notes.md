## Public API Changes

### Convert PowerPoint Presentation to video with animations and transitions

We've added a new feature: PowerPoint presentation-to-video conversion. This feature includes:
* animation of transitions between slides
* shape animation 
* text animation

Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET can now play presentations and generate a set of frames with a specific frame per second (FPS). Those frames can then be used to create a video through tools like FFmpeg.

This Python code demonstrates a presentation to video export operation with frames set at 30 FPS:

```python
import aspose.slides as slides

fps = 30

with slides.Presentation("animated.pptx") as presentation:
    with slides.export.PresentationEnumerableFramesGenerator(presentation, fps) as frames_generator:
        for frame_args in frames_generator.enumerate_frames(presentation.slides):
            frame_args.get_frame().save("frame_{}.png".format(frame_args.frames_generator.frame_index))
```

The [PresentationEnumerableFramesGenerator](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.export/presentationenumerableframesgenerator/) class is a source that sequentially generates individual animation effects. Method `PresentationEnumerableFramesGenerator.enumerate_frames` allow you to enumerate the frames and save them to disk or write to a video stream.
