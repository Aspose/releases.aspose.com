# Improved Support for Ubuntu Focal

It was observed that while converting Microsoft PowerPoint&reg; `PPTX` to `PDF` format few issues popped up on Ubuntu Focal. Those issues have now been resolved.

# 3D Column Charts Support

This API release introduces the support of 3D Column Charts. Now you may add chart with default data and then set `Rotation3D` properties (such as right angle axis, depth percent, etc.).

# Improved Hebrew Text Effect Support

Previously it was observed that in some instances the Hebrew text shadow was being incorrect when `PPTX` presentations are converted to `PDF` format. This issue has now been resolved.
