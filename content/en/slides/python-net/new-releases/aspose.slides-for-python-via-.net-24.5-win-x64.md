This update of Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET 24.5 helps developers create professional presentations programmatically within their Python applications running on 64-bit Windows systems.

### Transparency for Table and Cell Fills

The new `transparency` property for `ICellFormat` and `ITableFormat` in the latest Python PowerPoint API provides greater control over presentation aesthetics. Please check out the following code example which highlights the usage of the `transparency` property for controlling the fill color transparency.

```python

import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation("pres.pptx") as presentation:
    table = presentation.slides[0].shapes[0]
    table.table_format.transparency = 0.5

```

### Table Transparency Control

This release of Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET introduces the ability to set transparency for tables, allowing for improved design flexibility on Win x64 apps.

### Enhanced Text Box Formatting

Python developers can now enable setting a default font size for all text boxes in all slides and centralize text formatting across multiple presentation slides.

### Modern API Transition

Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET 24.5 streamlines development with updates to the `ShapeElement` and `ShapeUtil` classes, paving the way for a more modern API experience on Windows x64 systems.
