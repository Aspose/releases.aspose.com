Manipulate PowerPoint presentations on macOS ARM64 systems with Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET 24.5. This version helps developers make professional presentations programmatically within their apps.

### Table and Cell Fills Transparency on macOS

With the new `transparency` property for `ICellFormat` and `ITableFormat` in this Python PowerPoint API release, you can enjoy finer control over presentation aesthetics. Please check out the following code example which highlights the usage of the `transparency` property for controlling the fill color transparency on macOS M1-powered machines.

```python

import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation("pres.pptx") as presentation:
    table = presentation.slides[0].shapes[0]
    table.table_format.transparency = 0.5

```

### Table Transparency Control

Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET 24.5 provides you the capability to apply transparency for tables, enabling improved design flexibility on Apple Mac applications.

### Text Box Formatting Management

You can now set a default font size for all text boxes in all slides and unify text formatting across multiple presentation slides.

### Modern API Transition

Experience streamlined development with updates to the `ShapeElement` and `ShapeUtil` classes in the latest Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET version, paving the way for a more modern API experience on macOS ARM64/M1 systems.
