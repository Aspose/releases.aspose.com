Great news for macOS developers! Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET 23.12 brings a wave of exciting new features and enhancements to your Python development environment on macOS x64 systems.

### Key Highlights

- **Handouts Made Easy:** Effortlessly create handouts that perfectly suit your audience's needs using Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET 23.12 and integrate the ability to render presentations in various customizable layouts in your apps.
- **Unleash the Power of PDFs:** Export presentations to PDF format with awesome image quality and enhanced functionality using the latest release of the presentation manipulation API â€“ all optimized for your macOS x64 machine.
- **Fine-tune Ink Objects in Presentations:** We have introduced the `InkOptions` class with the latest update. This powerful tool lets you control exactly how ink objects appear in your exported documents, allowing you to achieve the perfect look and feel for your presentations.
- **Streamlined Presentations:** With this update, you can reduce file size and create efficient presentations by automatically removing unnecessary cropped picture areas.


### Export Presentations as Handouts

Python developers can now export PowerPoint presentations as handouts effortlessly on macOS x64 using the newly introduced `HandoutType` enum, which includes different supported handout types. The following Python code snippet illustrates how to render a presentation in a handout layout:

```Python
with Presentation("pres.pptx") as pres:
    options = RenderingOptions()
    options.slides_layout_options = HandoutLayoutingOptions()
    options.slides_layout_options.handout = HandoutType.HANDOUTS_4_HORIZONTAL
    options.slides_layout_options.print_slide_numbers = False

    pres.slides[0].get_thumbnail(options, Size(1920, 1080)).save("pres-handout.png")

```

### Ink Objects Management

Version 23.12 of the Python API introduces the new `InkOptions` class and the corresponding `IInkOptions` interface. This gives you control over how Ink objects appear in your exported documents, allowing you to customize the look and feel of your presentations. Please refer to the following Python code to learn about its usage:

```Python
with Presentation("pres.pptx") as pres:
    options = PdfOptions()
    options.ink_options.hide_ink = True

    pres.save("pres.pdf", SaveFormat.PDF, options)

```

### Removing Cropped Areas in Images on macOS

Using the newly added `IPictureFillFormat.delete_picture_cropped_areas()` method in this release of the Python API, you can seamlessly remove the cropped areas from an image and optimize the size of your presentations on macOS x64 machines. The following sample code demonstrates how to use this method:

```Python
with Presentation("demo.pptx") as presentation:
    slide = presentation.slides[0]

    # Gets the picture frame
    pic_frame = slide.shapes[0]

    # Deletes cropped areas of the picture frame image
    cropped_image = pic_frame.picture_format.delete_picture_cropped_areas()

```
