This release of Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET 24.5 allows developers to create professional presentations programmatically within their Python PowerPoint applications running on 32-bit Windows systems.

### Table and Cell Fills Transparency

The latest Python PowerPoint API release includes new `transparency` property for `ICellFormat` and `ITableFormat` which provides better control over presentation aesthetics. Please check out the following code example which highlights the usage of the `transparency` property for controlling the fill color transparency on Win x32.

```python

import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation("pres.pptx") as presentation:
    table = presentation.slides[0].shapes[0]
    table.table_format.transparency = 0.5

```

### Control Transparency of Tables

Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET 24.5 delivers the capability to apply transparency for tables, allowing for improved design flexibility on Windows x32 apps.

### Improved Text Box Formatting

Developers can now set a default font size for all text boxes in all slides and centralize text formatting across multiple presentation slides.

### Modern API Transition

With this Python API version, we have streamlined development with updates to the `ShapeElement` and `ShapeUtil` classes, paving the way for a more modern API experience on 32-bit Windows machines.
