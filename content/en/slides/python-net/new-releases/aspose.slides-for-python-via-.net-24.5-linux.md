We are pleased to announce the Linux release of Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET 24.5. This version lets developers create professional presentations within their Python PowerPoint apps running on Linux systems.

### Handle Table and Cell Fills Transparency

The newly added `transparency` property for `ICellFormat` and `ITableFormat` in the latest Python PowerPoint API release provides better control over presentation aesthetics. Please check out the following code example which highlights the usage of the `transparency` property for controlling the fill color transparency on Win x32.

```python

import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation("pres.pptx") as presentation:
    table = presentation.slides[0].shapes[0]
    table.table_format.transparency = 0.5

```

### Manage Table Transparency

Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET 24.5 provides the functionality to apply transparency for tables, allowing for improved design flexibility on Linux-based apps.

### Centralize Text Box Formatting

Using the latest Python API version, apply a default font size for all text boxes in all slides and centralize text formatting across multiple presentation slides.

### Modern API Transition

We have simplified development in this release of Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET with updates to the `ShapeElement` and `ShapeUtil` classes, paving the way for a more modern API experience on Linux machines.
