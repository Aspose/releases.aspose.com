# Set Frame Rendering & Rotation Behavior

Ability to specify and control the behavior of frame rotation and frame size while rendering shapes from `PPTX` and other supported presentation formats.

# Compress Embedded Fonts to Reduce Presentation Size

If your presentation contains the embedded fonts then this release of our presentation processing Python API offers the ability to perform compression of all such embedded fonts and in turn reduces the size of the presentation files such as `PPTX`.

# Set Presentation Leader Lines Color

This API release introduces the ability to set color of leader lines within your presentation slides.
