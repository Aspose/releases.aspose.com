macOS x64 developers can utilize the Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET 24.5 release to create professional presentations within their Python PowerPoint apps.

### Table and Cell Fills Transparency Handling

We have added the `transparency` property for `ICellFormat` and `ITableFormat` in this Python PowerPoint API release which provides better control over presentation aesthetics. Please check out the following code example which highlights the usage of the `transparency` property for controlling the fill color transparency on macOS x64 machines.

```python

import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation("pres.pptx") as presentation:
    table = presentation.slides[0].shapes[0]
    table.table_format.transparency = 0.5

```

### Control Table Transparency

Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET 24.5 allows you to apply transparency for tables, enabling improved design flexibility on Apple Mac applications.

### Unified Text Box Formatting

The latest Python API version enables applying a default font size for all text boxes in all slides and centralizes text formatting across multiple presentation slides.

### Modern API Transition

With this release of Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET, you can experience streamlined development with updates to the `ShapeElement` and `ShapeUtil` classes, paving the way for a more modern API experience on macOS x64 systems.
