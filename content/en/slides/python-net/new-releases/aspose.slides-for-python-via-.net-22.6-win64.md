# Updated Presentation Source Locking Behavior

The obsolete PresentationLockingBehavior `LOAD_AND_RELEASE_LEGACY_TEMPORARY_DEFAULT` ENUM member has been removed. `LOAD_AND_RELEASE` is the default presentation locking behavior now. 

This default setting locks the source only for the time of `IPresentation` constructor execution.
