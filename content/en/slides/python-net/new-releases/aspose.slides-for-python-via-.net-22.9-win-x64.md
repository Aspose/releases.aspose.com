# Support for Apple&reg;'s macOS&reg;

This presentation manipulation Python API release introduces the support for the macOS&reg;.

# Get Font Substitution Information

Ability to get the information about the fonts being replaced during presentation rendering. A new method, `get_substitutions()`, has been added to achieve this.

# Set Timing for Slide Animation

Now you may set the timing to repeat the presentation slide animation via the following two new properties added to the [`Timing`](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/python-net/aspose.slides.animation/timing/) class:

- `repeat_until_next_click`: this bool property sets if the animation effect is repeated until the mouse button is next clicked.
- `repeat_until_end_slide`: this bool property sets if the slide animation effect is repeated until the end of the current slide.
