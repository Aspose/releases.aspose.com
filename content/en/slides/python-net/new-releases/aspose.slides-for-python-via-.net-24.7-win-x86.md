Unleash the full potential of your PowerPoint documents in your Python applications with Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET 24.7 on Windows 32-bit systems. The latest update empowers developers with different new features and enhancements.

### Effortless PDF Embedding

Embed other files into your PDF documents during export and enhance your presentations with valuable context. Here is how to use this feature in Python.

```python

import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation("pres.pptx") as pres:
    options = slides.export.PdfOptions()
    options.include_ole_data = True
    pres.save("pres.pdf", slides.export.SaveFormat.PDF, options)

```

### Beefed Up Security

Take care of possible security issues effectively by removing integrated binary data (VBA, OLE objects, ActiveX controls) while loading the presentation on Win32 powered machines, as illustrated in this code example.

```python

import aspose.slides as slides

load_options = slides.LoadOptions()
load_options.delete_embedded_binary_objects = True

with slides.Presentation("malware.ppt", loadOptions) as pres:
   pres.save("clean.ppt", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPT)

```

### Work with Password-protected Presentations

Experience better handling of password-protected presentation files with Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET 24.7 and ascertain secure access and manipulation.

### Number Slides Accurately

Offer clarity and eliminate confusion for your end users with accurate slide number counting. Exclude comment pages for precise presentation navigation on Windows x32 systems.

### Integrate Placeholders into Layout Slides

Programmatically add placeholder shapes, such as charts, content, text, pictures, tables, and more to your layout slides using the presentation manipulation Python API. The following code example demonstrates the feature usage.

```python

import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation() as pres:
    # Getting the Blank layout slide
    layout = pres.layout_slides.get_by_type(slides.SlideLayoutType.BLANK)

    # Getting the placeholder manager of the layout slide
    placeholder_manager = layout.placeholder_manager

    # Adding different placeholders to the Blank layout slide
    placeholder_manager.add_content_placeholder(10, 10, 300, 200)
    placeholder_manager.add_vertical_text_placeholder(350, 10, 200, 300)
    placeholder_manager.add_chart_placeholder(10, 350, 300, 300)
    placeholder_manager.add_table_placeholder(350, 350, 300, 200)

    # Adding the new slide with Blank layout
    new_slide = pres.slides.add_empty_slide(layout)
    pres.save("placeholders.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)

```
