#### Release Highlights

Aspose.OMR for .NET 24.12 delivers a major boost in recognition accuracy for skewed, distorted, or resized form images. This update resolves critical matching errors and improves data reliability across varied input formats.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- *No new APIs introduced in this release.*

### üîß Enhancement

- **Improved Recognition Engine**: The OMR engine now handles disproportionately resized or heavily skewed images with significantly higher accuracy‚Äîideal for mobile-captured photos taken at extreme angles.
- **Critical Fix Applied**: Resolved the recurring error message: ‚ÄúFailed to find matching between the template and the image!‚Äù by enhancing geometric correction algorithms during recognition.

### üõ† Fix

- No additional bug fixes listed separately from the recognition engine improvement.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecation Notice

You have **1 month left** to migrate away from the following deprecated methods, which will be removed in version 25.1.0 (January 2025):
- `GenerateTemplate()`
- `GenerateJSONTemplate()`
- `GenerateJSONTemplateFromString()`

Transition to the universal `Generate()` method to maintain compatibility.
