#### Release Highlights

The DLLs-only version of Aspose.OMR for .NET 25.4 brings refined control over `CustomAnswerSheet` layout and fixes bugs affecting UI bubble display and international digit rendering.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Fine-Grained Bubble Layout Controls**: Developers can now configure individual `BubbleArray` sections using:
  - `threshold`: Customizes how dark a mark must be to be considered selected.
  - `height`: Manually set the row height for better layout uniformity.
  - `vertical_padding` / `horizontal_padding`: Add spacing around bubbles for improved clarity in dense forms.

These additions make it easier to design high-fidelity, exam-ready forms without post-processing layout tweaks.

### üîß Enhancement

- *No standalone enhancements noted beyond the new layout controls.*

### üõ† Fix

- **UI Rendering Fix**: Corrected misaligned bubble elements in the `CorrectionUI` visual wrapper.
- **Digit Localization**: Addressed form generation problems with non-Western numeral formats.
