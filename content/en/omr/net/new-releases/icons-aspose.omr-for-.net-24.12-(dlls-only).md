#### Release Highlights

The DLLs-only release of Aspose.OMR for .NET 24.12 focuses on enhancing recognition performance in real-world form scanning conditions, including distorted images and angular photographs.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- *No new APIs introduced in this release.*

### üîß Enhancement

- **Advanced Image Correction**: Recognition engine now compensates for perspective distortion and irregular resizing more effectively, reducing false negatives.
- **Error Resolution**: Eliminates the ‚ÄúFailed to find matching between the template and the image!‚Äù issue caused by misalignment and poor scaling in input images.

### üõ† Fix

- Recognition alignment issues have been resolved within the enhanced engine.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecation Reminder

The following methods are deprecated and will be removed in version 25.1.0 (January 2025). Update your code now:
- `GenerateTemplate()`
- `GenerateJSONTemplate()`
- `GenerateJSONTemplateFromString()`

Use the `Generate()` method for long-term compatibility.
