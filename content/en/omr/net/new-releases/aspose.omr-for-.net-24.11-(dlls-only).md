#### Release Highlights

The DLLs-only release of Aspose.OMR for .NET 24.11 introduces full support for interactive form PDFs‚Äîmaking digital OMR workflows as seamless as printed ones.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Save Fillable Forms**: Generate interactive PDFs with embedded checkboxes and fields using new `SaveAsInteractivePdf()` APIs for both individual and batch forms.
- **Digital Recognition**: Aspose.OMR now reads completed interactive forms with the same precision as scanned paper forms, streamlining hybrid data collection.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Streamlined Output Options**: Export interactive PDFs directly to a stream using `ExportPageInteractivePdf()` or `ExportFormInteractivePdf()` for finer control in memory-based workflows.

### üõ† Fix

- No fixes included in this DLL update.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecation Reminder

Legacy generation methods are still operational but scheduled for removal in 25.1.0:
- `GenerateTemplate()`
- `GenerateJSONTemplate()`
- `GenerateJSONTemplateFromString()`

Migration window ends in January 2025.
