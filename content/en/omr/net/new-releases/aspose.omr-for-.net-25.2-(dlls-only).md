#### Release Highlights

Aspose.OMR for .NET 25.2 DLLs-only release enables advanced form recognition workflows with customizable validation logic, per-question answer limits, and comprehensive exception handling.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Business Logic Enforcement**:
  - Control recognition behavior using `FormValidationLogic.Ignore` or `Exception`.
  - Enforce single-answer rules on quizzes and assessments with clear error feedback.

- **Structured Exception Handling**:
  - Catch invalid form fills with new `OMRException` and `MultiselectException` classes for better diagnostics and automation.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Multiselect Property Integration**:
  - Element-level support for `multiselect=false` across `choicebox`, `checkbox`, and `answer_sheet`.
  - Works with `GlobalPageSettings` or per-element override to enforce stricter form input expectations.
- **Improved API Usability**: Fixed inaccessibility of `ChoiceBoxAnswerConfig` for developers working with complex form layouts.

### üõ† Fix

- **API Accessibility Fix**: Resolved a bug where `ChoiceBoxAnswerConfig` could not be accessed through the public API.
