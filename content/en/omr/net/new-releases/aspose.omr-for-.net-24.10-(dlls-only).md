#### Release Highlights

Aspose.OMR for .NET 24.10 DLLs-only package improves document readability by introducing hyphenation for long words and extends universal form API support.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Hyphenation for Long Words**: The `LongWordHandling.Hyphenation` setting is now available in layout configurations to automatically split overlong words at margins, ensuring output remains clean and printable.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Improved Word Wrapping**: Enhances form readability without requiring manual text shortening or custom spacing.
- **Legacy API Support Maintained**: Although deprecated, older generation methods continue to work for now to ensure a smooth migration.

### üõ† Fix

- No specific fixes delivered in this release.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecation Reminder

These legacy APIs are deprecated and scheduled for removal in version 25.1.0:
- `GenerateTemplate()`
- `GenerateJSONTemplate()`
- `GenerateJSONTemplateFromString()`

Update your projects to the `OmrEngine.Generate()` method soon.
