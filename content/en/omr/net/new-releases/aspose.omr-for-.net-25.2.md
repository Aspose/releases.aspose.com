#### Release Highlights

Aspose.OMR for .NET 25.2 adds customizable business logic and validation for form recognition, including per-question multiselect rules and structured error handling to help enforce strict form completion standards.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Custom Validation Logic**: Define strict rules for form recognition using the new `FormValidationLogic` enum. Choose between ignoring or throwing exceptions on invalid entries (e.g., multiple selections in single-answer questions).
- **New Exceptions for Better Debugging**:
  - `OMRException`: Catches unrecoverable issues during recognition or generation.
  - `MultiselectException`: Triggers when form rules (like one answer per question) are violated.

### üîß Enhancement

- **Multiselect Property Support**:
  - Now supported in `GlobalPageSettings`, `choicebox`, `checkbox`, and `answer_sheet` elements.
  - Enforces strict single-selection rules for quiz or exam forms when `multiselect=false`.
  - Defaults to backward-compatible behavior (`true`) for forms from earlier versions.
- **Improved API Access**: The `ChoiceBoxAnswerConfig` is now directly accessible for better integration with the API.

### üõ† Fix

- **Resolved Inaccessibility Issue**: Fixed a problem where the `ChoiceBoxAnswerConfig` element was not available through direct API calls.
