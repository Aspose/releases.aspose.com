Developers, optimize your Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) workflows with the latest update to Aspose.OMR for .NET (version 24.7, DLLs-only). The DLLs package simplifies integration with your .NET projects across Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms. 

### Seamless Barcode Rotation

Apply accurate barcode positioning using the newly added `rotation_angle` property for barcode elements in this version of the C# barcode recognition API. Easily rotate barcodes clockwise or counter-clockwise for optimum recognition.

### Form Generation Accuracy Boost

With the newest .NET API release, you can enhance the accuracy of the generated forms while using elements with dynamic width. It ascertains precise data capture in your platform-independent C# applications, even with dynamic form designs.
