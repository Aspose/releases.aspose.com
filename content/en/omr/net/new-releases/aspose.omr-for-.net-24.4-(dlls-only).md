Aspose.OMR for .NET 24.4 (DLLs-only) is here to elevate the OMR form processing capabilities of your C# and VB.NET applications. This release introduces support for images of any bit depth, granting you unparalleled flexibility.

### Support for Processing Images with Any Bit Depth

The latest OMR API for .NET release immaculately reads images with any bit depth, such as monochrome (1-bit), 16-color palettes (4-bit), and high-fidelity 24/32-bit color images. With the addition of this feature, we have eliminated the need for pre-processing images.

### Integration Transparency

Aspose.OMR for .NET 24.4 lets you experience convenient integration into your existing codebase. You do not need any code modifications to leverage the broader image depth support.

### Backward Compatibility

The .NET OMR library maintains complete backward compatibility to ensure a seamless transition for your C# apps. It allows developers to remain focused on the core job without having to worry about compatibility issues while developing C# optical mark recognition apps.
