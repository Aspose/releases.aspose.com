## Deprecation warning

{{% alert color="caution" %}}
Release 23.6.1 introduced a straightforward and easier API that can greatly simplify code and enhance the capabilities of your OMR applications. Unfortunately, the major reorganization of methods and modifications of internal logic result in "breaking changes".

To make it easier to upgrade your code, we have kept existing methods fully functional, but marked them as deprecated. Your existing code will continue to work and you can even make minor updates to it, but be aware that all deprecated methods are scheduled to be removed in the release **24.1.0 (January 2024)** in favor of the new API.

**Time to deprecation: 2 months left.**
