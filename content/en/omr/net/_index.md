## What is optical mark recognition (OMR)?

As the name suggests, OMR is used to process a large number of uniform hand-filled questionnaires where you answer a question by drawing a random mark in a circle or a square (also known as a "bubble"). It has a large number of applications across different areas such as education, exams, voting, surveys, border entry forms, customs declarations, health insurance claims, bank applications, visas, and many more.

Manual reading and aggregation of results from hundreds and thousands of forms is a painfully long, tedious and error-prone. Aspose.OMR for .NET fully automates the process, allowing hundreds of sheets per minute to be recognized with nearly 100% accuracy, and saves the results in machine-readable tables for further aggregation and analysis. In addition to bubble recognition, the library can also parse the contents of handwritten fields for processing names, numbers and answers to open-ended questions.

On a large scale, OMR involves specialized scanners (optical mark readers), unique transoptic paper, magnetic ink and other "hardware" solutions. Providing unsurpassed recognition speed and reliability, these devices are very expensive and rarely needed for small and medium businesses, occasional jobs or non-routine tasks. Aspose.OMR for .NET does not require a dedicated hardware - all you need are a regular pen and paper, common office equipment, and a smartphone camera.

## Why Aspose.OMR for .NET?

Create and recognize machine-readable forms of any layout and complexity in on-premise applications, web services, or in the cloud. Our solution is suitable for projects of any size - from simple surveys and quizzes to final exams and elections.

- **No equipment needed**  
  Use your existing office copier or even a smartphone camera instead of a specialized OMR reader.
- **Full personalization**  
  Personalize OMR forms by adding automatically generated QR codes and barcodes, images, signature fields, and more.
- **Reliable results**  
  Robust optical mark detection algorithms coupled with the capability to fine-tune recognition guarantee 100% accurate results.
- **Whole solution**  
  Aspose.OMR for .NET supports the complete OMR workflow - from designing a form to recognizing its filled hardcopies.
- **Developer-friendly**  
  Our API is extremely easy to use even for inexperienced developers. A simple OMR application can be written in 10 lines of code.
- **Built-in OCR**  
  Convert handwritten input into machine-readable text. No external OCR libraries are required!
- **Global applications**  
  Aspose.OMR for .NET can create and recognize multi-language forms. It makes the library suitable for global applications, including international surveys, educational assessments, and cross-cultural research projects. It allows you to offer respondents forms in the language in which they are most comfortable: English, French and other European languages; Cyrillic; Arabic; Persian; Hebrew; Urdu; Bengali.

## System requirements

Aspose.OMR for .NET is a self-contained development library that does not require additional software or third-party components to be installed.

It is a cross-platform library that can work on any device which supports .NET Framework 4.x and .NET 5.0 or later, including smartphones.

## Designing machine-readable form

Aspose.OMR for .NET offers you several ways to design machine-readable forms of any layout and complexity. They all work equally well and produce the same results - just choose the approach that you are most comfortable with:

- [**Draw the form interactively**](https://products.aspose.app/omr/omr-sheet-designer)  
  Design machine-readable forms with our [free online editor](https://products.aspose.app/omr/omr-sheet-designer). Simply place the elements on the sheet using your mouse, drag, and resize them to best suit your requirements. Moreover, you can take it a step further and design Aspose.OMR forms directly from your approved templates and printouts, using the original image as a background.  
  Once done, you get the printable OMR sheet and a special recognition pattern file that is required for Aspose.OMR API to recognize the hand-filled marks. The OMR sheet image can be printed on a regular office printer and filled with a pen, pencil or marker. Use your existing office copier or even a smartphone camera to capture an image of the completed form and recognize it with Aspose.OMR library.
- [**Text markup**](https://docs.aspose.com/omr/txt-markup/)  
  Describe the content and layout of Aspose.OMR forms using lightweight markup language. It is content-focused, with minimal number of tags or formatting instructions.
- [**JSON markup**](https://docs.aspose.com/omr/json-markup/)  
  Use easy-to-read hierarchical notation to describe even the most complex OMR forms. It supports syntax highlighting, automatic formatting, and code folding in all popular code editors.
- [**Build forms programmatically**](https://docs.aspose.com/omr/net/programmatic-forms/)  
  Build OMR forms directly in the application code. Although it takes much more coding than generating forms from text or JSON sources, this approach works best when you need to design forms with personalized fields such as a respondent’s name, unique QR code and the like.

The forms can be personalized with automatically generated barcodes and QR codes, respondent’s name, unique identifiers, and photos. You can also brand OMR forms by adding your logo, corporate footers, and more. Experiment with layouts, question formats, and answer structures, all while ensuring the consistent accuracy of mark recognition. Enjoy a creative design process and say goodbye to complex design processes and embrace a straightforward approach to form creation.

### Code snippet

You only need a few lines of code to build machine-readable  150-question OMR sheet.

**Text markup**

```txt
?text=Quiz
   font_size=16
   font_style=bold
?empty_line=
?answer_sheet=Plants
   columns_count=3
   elements_count=150
   answers_count=5
```

**Generating printable form**

```csharp
var omrEngine = new Aspose.OMR.Api.OmrEngine();
var generationResult = omrEngine.GenerateTemplate("source.txt");
if(generationResult.ErrorCode != 0)
{
   Console.WriteLine(generationResult.ErrorMessage);
   return generationResult.ErrorCode;
}
generationResult.Save("folder", "OMR-Form");
```

## Recognizing OMR forms

With Aspose.OMR for .NET, you can create a fully-functional programmatic optical mark reader in **4** lines of code. You can use your existing office copier or even a smartphone camera instead of an expensive OMR scanner. Respondents can fill out your forms with pen, pencil, or marker and use any types of marks.

```csharp
var omrEngine = new Aspose.OMR.Api.OmrEngine();
var templateProcessor = omrEngine.GetTemplateProcessor("pattern.omr");
var recognitionResult = templateProcessor.Recognize("filled-form.png");
string result = recognitionResult.GetCsv();
```
