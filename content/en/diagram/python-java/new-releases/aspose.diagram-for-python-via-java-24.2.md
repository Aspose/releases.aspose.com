### Accurate VSDX to SVG Conversion

Aspose.Diagram for Python via Java 24.2 streamlines VSDX to SVG conversion by resolving text layout issues and accurately representing gradient fills.

### Improved Text Rendering: 

Text elements within VSDX diagrams are now converted to SVG with proper layout without any inconsistencies.

### Preserved Gradient Fills

With the latest Python diagram API release, gradient fills applied to shapes in VSDX diagrams are maintained during the conversion process resulting in refined SVG representations.

### Corrected Icon Placement

The issues related to the positioning of icons on the top left and right corners of diagrams have been addressed in this API version.

Download Aspose.Diagram for Python via Java 24.2 and enhance Visio diagram processing capabilities in your Python app.
