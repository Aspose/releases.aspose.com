# **Aspose.Diagram for Node.js via Java has been launched!**
We are pleased to announce the first public release of Aspose.Diagram for Node.js via Java. It is a scalable and feature-rich API to integrate Microsoft Visio® file generation, manipulation, conversion & processing features into your own Node.js applications. It is a subset component that includes all the important and useful features present in its native [Aspose.Diagram for Java](https://www.aspose.com/products/diagram/java). This new API is an equally robust and feature-rich component, and supports high-fidelity file format conversion to and from VSD, VSDX, VSS, VSSX, VTX, VDX, VDW, VST, VSTX, VSX, HTML, PDF and XML Paper Specification (XPS) in Node.js. Please visit [Product features comparison page](https://docs.aspose.com/diagram/java/aspose-diagram-for-node-js-via-java-features/) for your reference.
