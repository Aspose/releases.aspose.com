# Improvements in Visio to SVG Conversion

This release offers various improvements in the handling of SVG conversion. Now the Russian text is being aligned correctly while converting Microsoft Visio&reg; to SVG format.

Also previously some curved shapes were loosing their curve after they are converted to the SVG vector format. This issue has now been resolved.
