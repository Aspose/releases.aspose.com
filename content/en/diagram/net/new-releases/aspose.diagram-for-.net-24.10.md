#### Release Highlights

Aspose.Diagram for .NET 24.10 focuses on two critical bug fixes: eliminating unexpected rendering artifacts in PDF output and correcting a `System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException` thrown by the `Shapes.Group` method during shape grouping operations.

### ðŸ›  Fix

- **VSDX to PDF Line Artifact**:  
  Fixed an issue where an unexpected rogue line appeared after saving a VSDX diagram to PDF format.

- **Shapes.Group Exception**:  
  Resolved a `System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException` thrown in some cases when using `Shapes.Group()` for shape manipulation and layout grouping.
