The DLLs-only package of Aspose.Diagram for .NET 24.1 offers valuable enhancements and bug fixes to optimize your diagramming capabilities within the .NET solutions.

### Key Highlights

- **Upgraded .NET 6 Support:** Effortlessly integrate Aspose.Diagram capabilities into .NET 6 applications, and utilize its powerful diagramming features in your latest projects.

### Bug Fixes

We have fixed several issues in version 24.1 of Aspose.Diagram for .NET:

- **Shape Flipping Corrected (DIAGRAMNET-53239):** The issue causing shapes to be flipped wrongly during VSD to VSDX conversion has been resolved in this C# Visio API update.
- **Visibility of Hidden Masters (DIAGRAMNET-53240):** Masters hidden in VSS files are no longer incorrectly displayed after converting to VSSX format.
- **Better LocPinY Handling (DIAGRAMNET-53242):** Manage the `LocPinY` property and ensure proper positioning of elements within diagrams.
- **Retain Shape Formulas (DIAGRAMNET-53243):** Grouping shapes no longer leads to formula loss, maintaining data integrity within your diagrams.
- **Shape Height Calculation Accuracy (DIAGRAMNET-53244):** Shape heights are now calculated precisely, resulting in visually accurate representations.
