#### Release Highlights

This DLLs-only update for Aspose.Diagram for .NET 24.10 addresses two key bug fixes, improving the reliability of grouped shape logic and VSDX to PDF rendering quality.

### ðŸ›  Fix

- **Unexpected Lines in PDF Export**:  
  Corrected visual artifacts where a rogue line would appear in the exported PDF output from VSDX files.

- **Group Method Exception**:  
  Fixed an `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` that was occasionally thrown when calling `Shapes.Group()` in complex Visio diagrams.
