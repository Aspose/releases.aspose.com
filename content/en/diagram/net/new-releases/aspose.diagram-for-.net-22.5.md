# Improved Async Method Execution

While converting Visio&reg; VSDX to PDF the output file was not being saved in the Async method until the program was fully executed. The current API release has solved this issue.

# Formula/Value Issue Resolution

Formula/Value fields were not being refreshing correctly. This issue has been resolved in the API.

# Better Table Text Handling in VSDX to PDF Conversion

During convert VSDX to PDF process, in some cases the text present in the table was getting removed. This issue is fixed now.
