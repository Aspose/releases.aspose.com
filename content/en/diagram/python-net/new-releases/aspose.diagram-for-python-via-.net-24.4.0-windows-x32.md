We are happy to announce the release of version 24.4.0 of the Aspose.Diagram for Python via .NET API for Windows 32-bit systems, which delivers an improved VSD to PNG conversion process and incorporates an internal library migration offering better performance.

### Converting VSD to PNG

This release of the Python Visio manipulation API includes optimized VSD to PNG conversion, as we have resolved the problems with OLE objects disappearing while converting VSD to PNG images.

### Upgraded Internal Performance

Python developers can now leverage the Aspose.Drawing components for enhanced internal performance. This migration from System.Drawing lays the groundwork for future upgrades and potential performance benefits on Windows x32 machines.

### Bug Fixes

- Improved handling of TIFF compression to ensure proper content viewability (DIAGRAMNET-53257, DIAGRAMNET-53262).
- Addressed inconsistencies in pasting behavior across different methods (DIAGRAMNET-53275).
- Resolved display issues with the tilde symbol and "Controlled Copy" text (DIAGRAMNET-53280, DIAGRAMNET-53281).
- Corrected path retrieval for OLE-linked Excel sheets (DIAGRAMNET-53282).
- Fixed an error related to the orientation option in Visio to HTML conversion (DIAGRAMNET-53311).
- Addressed a general error that could occur during orientation usage (DIAGRAMNET-53313).
