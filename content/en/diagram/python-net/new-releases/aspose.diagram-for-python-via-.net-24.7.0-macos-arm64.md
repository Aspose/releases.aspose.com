MacOS developers, rejoice! The latest release of Aspose.Diagram for Python via .NET (v24.7.0) is here, and it delivers updated connector control functionality to elevate your Python Visio apps running on macOS ARM64/M1 systems.

### Customize Connector Jump Code Values

The latest Python diagram API version enables inserting jump code and jump style values to connectors inside shapes. This update helps you create accurate and visually stunning diagrams on macOS M1-powered machines.

Code example:

```python

shape.SetConnectorJumpValue(ConLineJumpCodeValue.Always,ConLineJumpStyleValue.Arc);

```

### Updated Connection Point Placement

The connecting points placement feature has been optimized in this Python API release as we have taken care of the issues with connection points not working correctly.
