Aspose.Diagram for Python via .NET 24.4.0 includes an improved VSD to PNG conversion feature and incorporates an internal library migration offering better performance for your Python Visio manipulation apps running on macOS M1 powered machines.

### VSD to PNG Image Conversion

Add improved VSD to PNG conversion capabilities to your Visio processing solutions with this update to the Python API, as we have fixed the issues with OLE objects disappearing while converting VSD to PNG images on macOS ARM64.

### Supercharged Internal Performance

You can now leverage the Aspose.Drawing components for much improved internal performance. This migration from System.Drawing lays the groundwork for future updates and potential performance benefits.

### Bug Fixes

- Improved handling of TIFF compression to ensure proper content viewability (DIAGRAMNET-53257, DIAGRAMNET-53262).
- Addressed inconsistencies in pasting behavior across different methods (DIAGRAMNET-53275).
- Resolved display issues with the tilde symbol and "Controlled Copy" text (DIAGRAMNET-53280, DIAGRAMNET-53281).
- Corrected path retrieval for OLE-linked Excel sheets (DIAGRAMNET-53282).
- Fixed an error related to the orientation option in Visio to HTML conversion (DIAGRAMNET-53311).
- Addressed a general error that could occur during orientation usage (DIAGRAMNET-53313).
