# Improved Visio&reg; to SVG Export

It was observed that a Visio&reg; graphic is being displayed in poor quality when it is exported to `SVG` format. This issue has now been resolved.

# Improved Visio&reg; to HTML Export

In some instances while exporting Visio&reg; digrams to HTML format, the incorporated links were lost. This issue has now been resolved.
