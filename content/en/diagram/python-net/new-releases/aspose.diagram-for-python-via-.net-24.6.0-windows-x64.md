We are glad to announce the release of Aspose.Diagram for Python via .NET 24.6.0 on Windows 64-bit. This version includes a new feature that enhances page handling and theme color management to ensure a smoother user experience.

### Improved Page Handling

The newest Python Visio API release lets you experience meticulous page size adjustments and prevents content overflow with refined page handling features.

### Better Shape Customization

Version 24.6.0 of Aspose.Diagram for Python via .NET determines if a shape has a theme color and allows for more precise styling and control over your diagrams.

### Reliable Conversions

Seamlessly convert VSD and VSDX files by benefitting from improved conversion accuracy and reliability on Win64 architecture in the latest Python library release.

### Bug Fixes

- The page size option is not working properly.
- `AutoFitPageToDrawingContent`Â spilling over.
- Missing connections after converting VSD to VSDX.
- Missing cell values after converting the VSD diagram.
- Lost connection for saving VSD to VSDX when moving shape.
- Visio to HTML cropped image.
- Visio hyperlinks are not clickable after saving to HTML.

### Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

We have added `HasThemeColor` property to the `Shape class`, to identify if the shape has a theme color.
