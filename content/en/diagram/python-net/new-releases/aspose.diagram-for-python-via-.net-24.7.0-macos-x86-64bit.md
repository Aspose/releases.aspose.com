We are pleased to announce the release of the latest Aspose.Diagram for Python via .NET API v24.7.0. This update brings an enhanced connector control feature to level up your Python Visio files processing apps powered by macOS x64.

### Elevate Connector Jump Code Functionality

With the newest Python diagram API release, you can insert jump code and jump style values to connectors inside the diagram shapes. This feature helps you generate accurate and visually appealing Visio diagrams on macOS x64-powered machines.

Code example:

```python

shape.SetConnectorJumpValue(ConLineJumpCodeValue.Always,ConLineJumpStyleValue.Arc);

```
