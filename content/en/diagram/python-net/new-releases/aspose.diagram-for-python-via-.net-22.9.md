# View Visio&reg; Diagram Validation Rule Sets

It was observed that the RuleSets were not being appeared in the Visio&reg; diagram validation data. This issue has now been resolved.

# Improved VSDX to SVG Conversion

While converting the Visio&reg; `VSDX` to `SVG`, in some instances it was observed that all the text in the boxes was being gotten over the box border lines. This issue has now been resolved.
