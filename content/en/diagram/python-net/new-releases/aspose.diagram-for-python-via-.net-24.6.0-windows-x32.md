The latest release of Aspose.Diagram for Python via .NET (v24.6.0, Win x32) is here, and it delivers important features for enhanced page handling and theme color management to guarantee a refined user experience.

### Page Handling Boost

The Python Visio API now enables immaculate page size modifications and prevents content overflow with fine-tuned page handling functionality.

### Supercharged Shape Customization

Version 24.6.0 of Aspose.Diagram for Python via .NET helps you identify if a shape has a theme color and supports more accurate styling and control over your diagrams.

### Conversion Accuracy

Effortlessly transform VSD and VSDX files by benefitting from better conversion accuracy and reliability on Win32 architecture in the latest Python library version.

### Bug Fixes

- Lost connection for saving VSD to VSDX when moving shape.
- Missing cell values after converting the VSD diagram.
- The page size option is not working properly.
- `AutoFitPageToDrawingContent`Â spilling over.
- Missing connections after converting VSD to VSDX.
- Visio to HTML cropped image.
- Visio hyperlinks are not clickable after saving to HTML.

### Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

We have added `HasThemeColor` property to the `Shape class`, to identify if the shape has a theme color.
