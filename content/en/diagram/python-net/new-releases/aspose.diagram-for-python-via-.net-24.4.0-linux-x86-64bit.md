Linux developers can enhance their Python Visio manipulation apps using Aspose.Diagram for Python via .NET version 24.4.0. This release delivers an improved VSD to PNG conversion process and incorporates an internal library migration offering better performance.

### VSD to PNG Conversion

Developers can now integrate optimized VSD to PNG conversion functionality into their Visio processing solutions, as we have resolved the problems with OLE objects disappearing while converting VSD to PNG images on Linux.

### Internal Performance Upgrades

The latest API release utilizes the Aspose.Drawing components for enhanced internal performance. This migration from System.Drawing lays the groundwork for future upgrades and potential performance benefits on Linux machines.

### Bug Fixes

- Improved handling of TIFF compression to ensure proper content viewability (DIAGRAMNET-53257, DIAGRAMNET-53262).
- Addressed inconsistencies in pasting behavior across different methods (DIAGRAMNET-53275).
- Resolved display issues with the tilde symbol and "Controlled Copy" text (DIAGRAMNET-53280, DIAGRAMNET-53281).
- Corrected path retrieval for OLE-linked Excel sheets (DIAGRAMNET-53282).
- Fixed an error related to the orientation option in Visio to HTML conversion (DIAGRAMNET-53311).
- Addressed a general error that could occur during orientation usage (DIAGRAMNET-53313).
