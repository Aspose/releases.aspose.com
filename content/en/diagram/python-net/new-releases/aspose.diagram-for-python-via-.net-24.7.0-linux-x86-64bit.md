Integrate finer connector control capability into your Linux-powered Python Visio apps with Aspose.Diagram for Python via .NET 24.7.0 and level up your applications.

### Enhanced Connector Control

Linux developers can add custom jump code and jump style values to connectors within shapes with the latest Python diagram API release. This feature helps you create diagrams that are pleasing to the eye.

Code example:

```python

shape.SetConnectorJumpValue(ConLineJumpCodeValue.Always,ConLineJumpStyleValue.Arc);

```
