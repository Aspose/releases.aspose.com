Great news for macOS x64 developers! Aspose.Diagram for Python via .NET 24.4.0 release brings an improved VSD to PNG conversion process and incorporates an internal library migration offering better performance for your Python Visio manipulation apps.

### VSD to PNG Conversion on Apple Mac

Seamlessly integrate improved VSD to PNG conversion capabilities into your Visio processing solutions, as we have fixed the issues with OLE objects disappearing while converting VSD to PNG images on macOS x64.

### Internal Performance Improvements

Aspose.Diagram for Python via .NET 24.4.0 version leverages the Aspose.Drawing components for elevated internal performance. This migration from System.Drawing lays the groundwork for future updates and potential performance benefits.

### Bug Fixes

- Improved handling of TIFF compression to ensure proper content viewability (DIAGRAMNET-53257, DIAGRAMNET-53262).
- Addressed inconsistencies in pasting behavior across different methods (DIAGRAMNET-53275).
- Resolved display issues with the tilde symbol and "Controlled Copy" text (DIAGRAMNET-53280, DIAGRAMNET-53281).
- Corrected path retrieval for OLE-linked Excel sheets (DIAGRAMNET-53282).
- Fixed an error related to the orientation option in Visio to HTML conversion (DIAGRAMNET-53311).
- Addressed a general error that could occur during orientation usage (DIAGRAMNET-53313).
