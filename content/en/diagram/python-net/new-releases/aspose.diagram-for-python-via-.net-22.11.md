# Save XAML as Stream

Added the support for saving `XAML` as stream.

# Improved VSDX to PDF Conversion

It was observed that while saving digrams from Visio&reg; `VSDX` to `PDF` via App made the shapes lost. This issue has now been resolved.

# Improved VSDX to SVG Conversion

Previously in some instances while converting flowcharts from Visio&reg; `VSDX` to `SVG` led to lost image. This issue has now been resolved.
