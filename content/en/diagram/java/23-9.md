# What's new in the Aspose.Diagram for Java 23.9

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Diagram for Java 23.9 introduces a new API to retrieve a shape’s inherited group from its master. This release also addresses critical issues, including out-of-memory errors when loading Visio files, missing shapes at the top of diagrams, and application exits during PNG conversion.

## Enhancements

- **Retrieve Inherited Group from Shape Master**  
  Added support to access the group inherited by a shape from its master via `Shape.getInheritGroup()`.

## Bug Fixes

- **OutOfMemoryError When Loading Visio Files**  
  Fixed a memory overflow issue when processing large or complex Visio diagrams.

- **Application Exit During PNG Conversion**  
  Resolved an error that caused unexpected termination during PNG export.

- **Lost Shapes at Top of Diagram**  
  Fixed an issue where shapes positioned at the top of the diagram were missing in output.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Method in `Shape` Class**
  - `getInheritGroup()`:  
    Returns the inherited group for a shape derived from its master.

    **Example:**
    ```java
    System.out.println("SelectModeValue : " + shape.getInheritGroup().getSelectMode().getValue());
    ```
