# What's new in Aspose.Diagram for Java 24.1

## Release Highlights

The Aspose.Diagram for Java 24.1 release delivers important stability improvements by addressing several critical bugs in diagram loading, format conversion, and image rendering. These fixes enhance reliability when working with VSD and VSDX formats and exporting diagrams as images.

## Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Issue with Font-only Diagram Loading:**  
  Resolved a problem where loading diagrams containing only font definitions would fail. This fix ensures compatibility with minimalistic or font-centric Visio files.

- **VSD to VSDX Conversion Error Resolved:**  
  Fixed an issue where converting VSD files to VSDX format would throw an error related to unsupported image type-to-string conversion.

- **PNG Export Image Cropping Fixed:**  
  Addressed a bug where saving Visio diagrams to PNG format would result in the right half of the image being cropped or missing.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

There are no public API changes or backward-incompatible modifications in this release.
