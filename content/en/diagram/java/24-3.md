[Aspose.Diagram for Java](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/java) API is a solution for Microsoft Visio file manipulation requirements. It allows the Java applications to read, write, export and process Microsoft Visio diagrams while supporting all Visio objects & properties including shapes, pages, images, shape masters, stencils, text, layers, header, footers, user-defined cells, hyperlinks, file protection, geometries, text boxes, and comments.

Aspose.Diagram for Java can also be used to [apply protection to the Microsoft Visio drawings](https://docs.aspose.com/diagram/java/working-with-protection/) by locking backgrounds, stencils (master) as well as  shapes and styles to avoid any accidental amendments.

## Visio File Processing Features

- Load, create, save and convert Microsoft Visio diagrams.
- [Create Master from sctrach](https://docs.aspose.com/diagram/java/working-with-masters/) or add from Stencil of Shapes.
- Create, Layout and Auto-Fit Shapes as well as retrieve Visio Connectors and Font Information.
- Modify Geometry Section of a Connector Shape.
- Insert an ActiveX Control in the Visio Diagram.
- [Printing to specific printer](https://docs.aspose.com/diagram/java/working-with-print/) or set printer and document name.

## Get Started

Aspose.Diagram Java APIs are hosted at the [Aspose.Diagram Repository](https://releases.aspose.com/java/repo/com/aspose/aspose-diagram/). You can easily use Aspose.Diagram for Java API directly in your Maven projects with simple configurations. For the detailed instructions please visit [Installing Aspose.Diagram for Java from Aspose Repository](https://docs.aspose.com/diagram/java/installation/) documentation page.

## Auto-fit Visio Diagram using Java

```java
// For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-diagram/Aspose.Diagram-for-Java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = Utils.getDataDir(AutoFitShapesInVisio.class);

// load a Visio diagram
Diagram diagram = new Diagram(dataDir + "BFlowcht.vsdx");

// use saving options
DiagramSaveOptions options = new DiagramSaveOptions(SaveFileFormat.VSDX);

// set Auto fit page property
options.setAutoFitPageToDrawingContent(true);

// save Visio diagram
diagram.save(dataDir + "AutoFitShapesInVisio_Out.vsdx", options);
```
