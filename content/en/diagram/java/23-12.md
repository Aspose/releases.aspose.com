# What's new in the Aspose.Diagram for Java 23.12

## Release Highlights

The 23.12 release enhances flexibility when loading Visio files by introducing filtering for document properties only. It also improves compatibility with Jakarta-based containers and resolves connector endpoint bugs for more accurate shape connectivity management.

## New Features

- **Load Diagram with Document Properties Only**
  Added support for selectively loading diagram content using `LoadFilter` and `LoadDataFilterOptions`, enabling lightweight access to metadata without loading full shapes and layouts.

## Bug Fixes

- **Jakarta EE (TomEE 9) Compatibility**
  Improved support for Jakarta-based containers, resolving issues that occurred with Aspose.Total deployments in TomEE 9.

- **Connector Rule Endpoint Null Issue**
  Fixed a problem where the connector rule's endpoint was returning `null`, ensuring reliable diagram connection tracking.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Method in `Shape` Class**
  - `getRelationShapeCollection()`: Returns a `RelationShapeCollection` representing all related shapes for the given shape.

- **New Diagram-Level Features**
  - `LoadDataFilterOptions`: Provides options to filter what data is loaded from a diagram template.
  - `LoadFilter`: Allows setting a custom data filter when loading a diagram.

```java
LoadOptions options = new LoadOptions(LoadFileFormat.VSDX);
LoadFilter filter = new LoadFilter();
filter.setLoadDataFilterOptions(LoadDataFilterOptions.DOCUMENT_PROPERTIES);
options.setLoadFilter(filter);
Diagram diagram = new Diagram("template.vsdx", options);
```
