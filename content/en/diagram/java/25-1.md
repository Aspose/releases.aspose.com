# What's new in Aspose.Diagram for Java 25.1

## Release Highlights

Aspose.Diagram for Java 25.1 enhances the reliability of Visio diagram exports by resolving critical bugs affecting conversion output integrity and locale sensitivity in shape naming.

## Bug Fixes

- **Improved Visio to PDF/PNG Conversion Quality:**  
  Fixed an issue where converted PDF or PNG outputs from Visio files appeared corrupted or significantly different from the source. This ensures accurate layout and visual fidelity across export formats.

- **Shape NameU Locale Dependency Fixed:**  
  Resolved the issue where the `Shape.getNameU` method returned results influenced by the system locale. The method now provides consistent, locale-independent shape identifiers.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes
