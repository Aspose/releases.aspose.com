## What is Aspose.OCR for JavaScript via C++?

**Aspose.OCR for JavaScript via C++** allows you to extract text from scanned pages, photos, screenshots, and other images directly on a web page or from cross-platform Electron apps. It is based on WebAssembly (Wasm) technology, which allows the code to run on the end user’s device without the need for a web server. It can be natively integrated into your JavaScript context, including access to all web browser functions. Aspose.OCR for JavaScript via C++ provides the highest security when embedded on the web, and will enforce the browser’s same-origin and permissions security policies.

Our powerful and feature rich Optical Character Recognition (OCR) API supports 28 languages based on Latin, Cyrillic and Asian scripts, including Chinese and Hindi, and can recognize files in the most popular formats. Various processing filters allow you to recognize skewed, distorted and noisy images. The recognition results are returned in the most popular data exchange formats.
