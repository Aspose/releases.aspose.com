## What was changed

Key | Summary | Category
--- | ------- | --------
OCRNET-564<br />OCRNET-586 | Added an experimental [preprocessing filter](https://docs.aspose.com/ocr/net/dewarp/) that corrects geometric distortions on an image.<br />See **Added public APIs** for important details. | New feature

## Public API changes and backwards compatibility

This section lists all public API changes introduced in **Aspose.OCR for .NET 23.2.0** that may affect the code of existing applications.

### Added public APIs:

The following public APIs have been introduced in this release:

#### `PreprocessingFilter.AutoDewarping()`

Aspose.OCR for the .NET API has been extended with `PreprocessingFilter.AutoDewarping()` image preprocessing method that straightens severely curved and distorted images such as photographed pages from books, magazines, and the like. Such images are almost impossible to read by standard recognition algorithms.

{{% alert color="caution" %}}
In this release, the dewarping implementation is primarily for evaluation purposes. It takes a significant amount of time (_up to several minutes_) and has some limitations.
{{% /alert %}}

**Important considerations**

- It is highly recommended to use [`DetectAreasMode.CURVED_TEXT`](https://docs.aspose.com/ocr/net/areas-detection/curved_text/) areas detection mode to extract text from the dewarped image. Other area detection modes may produce inaccurate results.
- [Automatic skew correction](https://docs.aspose.com/ocr/net/deskew/) must be turned off. Its combination with dewarping may result in severe image distortion.
- Due to the high complexity of the underlying neural network, dewarping requires significant system resources.

### Updated public APIs:

_No changes._

### Removed public APIs:

_No changes._

## Usage examples

The examples below illustrates the changes introduced in this release:

### Correct geometric distortions

```csharp
Aspose.OCR.AsposeOcr recognitionEngine = new Aspose.OCR.AsposeOcr();
// Add dewarping filter
Aspose.OCR.Models.PreprocessingFilters.PreprocessingFilter filters = new Aspose.OCR.Models.PreprocessingFilters.PreprocessingFilter();
filters.Add(Aspose.OCR.Models.PreprocessingFilters.PreprocessingFilter.AutoDewarping());
// Save preprocessed image to file for debugging purposes
using(MemoryStream ms = recognitionEngine.PreprocessImage("source.png", filters))
{
	using(FileStream fs = new FileStream("result.png", FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write))
	{
		ms.WriteTo(fs);
	}
}
// Append preprocessing filters to recognition settings
Aspose.OCR.RecognitionSettings recognitionSettings = new Aspose.OCR.RecognitionSettings();
recognitionSettings.DetectAreasMode = Aspose.OCR.DetectAreasMode.CURVED_TEXT;
recognitionSettings.PreprocessingFilters = filters;
// Recognize image
Aspose.OCR.RecognitionResult result = recognitionEngine.RecognizeImage("source.png", recognitionSettings);
Console.WriteLine(result.RecognitionText);
```
