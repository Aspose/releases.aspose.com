From 2.2.0 version resource file for default language (English) is embedded into Aspose.OCR.dll and there is no need to download it separately. Currently recognition of French, Spanish and Portuguese languages is also supported.
Note that resource files were updated since v3.2.0 release. You can download specific resource files from this page.
