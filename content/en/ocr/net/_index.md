Add optical character recognition (OCR) to your .NET applications, web sites and cloud services with a few lines of code. Effortlessly transform images into machine-readable text and generate searchable PDFs from scanned pages.

## Why download Aspose.OCR for .NET?

Aspose.OCR for .NET is a robust, developer-friendly, and cost-effective API for optical character recognition. In less than 10 lines of native C# code, you can build OCR capabilities into your .NET desktop solutions, MVC-based Web applications, cloud services, and serverless Azure functions. Extract machine-readable text from scans, photos and screenshots, convert scanned pages into searchable and indexable PDFs, find and compare text on images focusing at business task rather than complex maths, neural networks, and other technical intricacies.

## Key features

- **Global applications** - supporting over 130 languages, the library allows you to recognize texts in Latin, Cyrillic and Asian scrips.
- **Read everything** - retrieve text from any file obtained through a scanner or camera, and process images directly from web links.
- **Reliable results** - achieve the highest recognition accuracy for all images, including those that are out-of-focus, rotated, distorted, and noisy.
- **Batch processing** - bulk-recognize all images from folders and archives; read multi-page PDF documents, TIFF images and DjVu files.
- **Layout detection** - identify and categorize content blocks in images to ensure the correct order of extracted text, regardless of layout.
- **Suitable for any content** - image preprocessing and customizable document structure detection enable text extraction from virtually any image, ranging from high-quality scans to street photos.
- **Optimized** - the library balances recognition speed, quality, and resource utilization for each specific use case.
- **Easy to use** - you only need a few lines of code to convert image to text, create a searchable PDF, save recognition results to document, and many more.
- **Modular** - keep your application lean and modular by selectively adding advanced features from our [resource repository](https://github.com/aspose-ocr/resources).
