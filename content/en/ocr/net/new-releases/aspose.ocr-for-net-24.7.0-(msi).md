The Aspose.OCR for .NET 24.7.0 (MSI) release brings essential stability improvements for image recognition on x86 platforms. This update is backward compatible and guarantees smooth integration into your existing C# OCR applications. 

### Enhanced x86 Platform OCR Stability

In this version of the C# library, we have introduced important changes to image recognition stability for optical character recognition (OCR) apps running on x86 architecture.

### Single-Threaded OCR on x86 Platforms

To avoid errors and improve system stability, OCR operations on x86 platforms now run exclusively on a single thread, which provides more consistent results.
