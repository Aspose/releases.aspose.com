App developers working with OCR technology can utilize the latest Aspose.OCR for .NET 24.8.0 (MSI) release. This release offers finer image processing capabilities, particularly for rotated and upside-down images, and ensures accurate text recognition in your C# OCR applications.

### Enhanced Image Skew Detection

Automatically detect and correct severely rotated or upside-down images using the latest C# OCR library for improved image OCR accuracy.

### Searchable PDF Background Handling

Background images in searchable PDFs are now processed with enhanced skew correction and resizing filters.

### ONNX Runtime Update

The ONNX Runtime dependency has been updated to version 1.18.0 in Aspose.OCR for .NET 24.8.0, which ensures compatibility with the latest models and optimizations.

### Deprecation Warning

Deprecated language codes must be updated by January 2025 to avoid issues with recognition languages in future releases.
