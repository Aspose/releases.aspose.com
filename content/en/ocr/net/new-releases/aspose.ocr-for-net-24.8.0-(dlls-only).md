Aspose.OCR for .NET 24.8.0 (DLLs Only) provides developers with enhanced OCR capabilities, focusing on improving the accuracy of skew correction and background image handling in PDFs across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### Advanced Image Skew Correction

The latest C# OCR library offers finer image OCR capability by automatically detecting and correcting severely rotated or upside-down images in your cross-platform OCR applications.

### Improved Background Image Processing in PDFs

Skew correction and resizing filters have been empowered in this release for fine-tuned processing of background images in searchable PDFs.

### ONNX Runtime Update

The ONNX Runtime dependency has been updated to version 1.18.0 in Aspose.OCR for .NET 24.8.0, to ensure compatibility with the latest models and optimizations.

### Deprecation Alert

You can stay ahead by updating deprecated language codes by January 2025 to avoid any issues with API usage.
