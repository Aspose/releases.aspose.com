Aspose.OCR for .NET 24.8.1 (DLLs only) delivers important updates that fine-tune the accuracy of OCR operations, especially in detecting headers and footers, and resolve multiple issues with image orientation and content recognition.

### Refined OCR Capability

This .NET OCR library release provides improved recognition functionality for headers and footers, enabling developers to experience more reliable optical character recognition within their C# apps.

### Bug Fixes
- Addressed an issue where some image content was overlooked by the OCR engine.
- Fixed a problem that resulted in empty pages during TIFF to searchable PDF conversion.
- Corrected incorrect image orientation detection that occasionally caused images to be rotated upside-down after processing.

### Deprecation Warning

Starting from version 24.8.1, developers should use the `Aspose.OCR.Country.NONE` setting to disable extraction from passport images instead of `Aspose.OCR.Country.UNIVERSAL`. Existing code will continue to work, but deprecated codes will be removed in release 25.1.0 (January 2025).
