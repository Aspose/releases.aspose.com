### Optimized OCR Accuracy

This release of Aspose.OCR for .NET (version 24.8.3, NuGet package) improves the recognition accuracy of headers and footers, ensuring accurate text capture, which is essential for document processing applications.

### Upgraded Recognition Functionality

The recognition precision for headers and footers has been increased in this release of the .NET OCR API to make it easier to extract structured information from various document types.

### Bug Fixes:
- Resolved an issue where certain image content was missed by the OCR engine.
- Fixed a bug that caused an empty page to appear while converting TIFF images into searchable PDFs.
- Addressed incorrect image orientation detection to eliminate instances where images were rotated upside-down after processing.
