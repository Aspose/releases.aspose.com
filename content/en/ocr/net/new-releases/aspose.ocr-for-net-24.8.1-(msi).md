Aspose.OCR for .NET 24.8.1 delivers crucial updates that refine the accuracy of OCR operations, particularly in the detection of headers and footers, and fix multiple issues affecting image orientation and content recognition.

### Refined OCR Functionality

The latest .NET OCR library version offers improved recognition for headers and footers, equiping developers with a more reliable OCR experience within their C# apps.

### Bug Fixes
- Addressed an issue where some image content was overlooked by the OCR engine.
- Fixed a problem that resulted in empty pages during TIFF to searchable PDF conversion.
- Corrected incorrect image orientation detection that occasionally caused images to be rotated upside-down after processing.

### Deprecation Warning

Starting from version 24.8.1, developers should use the `Aspose.OCR.Country.NONE` setting to disable extraction from passport images instead of `Aspose.OCR.Country.UNIVERSAL`. Existing code will continue to work, but deprecated codes will be removed in release 25.1.0 (January 2025).
