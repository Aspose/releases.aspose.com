### Rotated Image Correction
The newly released NuGet package of the .NET OCR API refines how Aspose.OCR handles rotated or upside-down images, which allows more accurate results, especially with larger skew angles. Developers no longer need to worry about common image alignment issues.

### Supercharged Searchable PDFs
Background images in searchable PDFs are now processed more efficiently. The filters applied during recognition ensure better accuracy without affecting the background image, making the resulting PDF documents cleaner and easier to use.

### ONNX Runtime Update
Aspose.OCR for .NET has now upgraded its ONNX Runtime dependency to version 1.18.0, to provide enhanced performance, especially when handling large datasets.
