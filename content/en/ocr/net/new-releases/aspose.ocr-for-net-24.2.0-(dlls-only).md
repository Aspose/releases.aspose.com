Aspose.OCR for .NET 24.2.0 (DLLs-only package) provides greater control over OCR functionalities. This release gives you the flexibility to choose which features to download and integrate into your .NET development projects.

### Enhanced PDF Recognition

Build optimized PDF recognition solutions to extract all document content from PDFs, such as text, vector graphics, and pictures. The latest release of the .NET OCR API equips you with the tools to recognize PDF documents effortlessly.

### Select What To Downloads

This version of Aspose.OCR for .NET lets you download only the required OCR features to reduce file size and simplify deployments.

### Control Resource Management

You can now manage the project resources and control whether to download them manually or automatically by default in .NET. Please check out the following steps and information to learn about downloading the resources manually.

- Add or create an aspose\ocr folder in the appâ€™s working directory.
- Then, download the https://github.com/aspose-ocr/resources/blob/main/aspose-ocr-cyrillic-v1.ocr file to the aspose\ocr directory.
- Now, block the automatic downloading of the resources using this code.

```c#

Resources.SetLocalPath("aspose/ocr");
Resources.AllowAutomaticDownloads(false);
// Set recognition language
Aspose.OCR.RecognitionSettings recognitionSettings = new Aspose.OCR.RecognitionSettings();
recognitionSettings.Language = Aspose.OCR.Language.Ukr;

```

### Seamless Cyrillic Characters Recognition

The latest C# API release allows recognizing Cyrillic characters easily within your .NET apps. The following code example highlights how to perform such recognition.

```c#

// Download Hindi OCR model to "aspose/ocr" directory in the application working directory
Aspose.OCR.Resources.SetLocalPath("aspose/ocr");
Aspose.OCR.Resources.FetchResource("aspose-ocr-cyrillic-v1");
// Initialize Aspose.OCR for .NET recognition API
Aspose.OCR.AsposeOcr recognitionEngine = new Aspose.OCR.AsposeOcr();
// Add images to OcrInput object
Aspose.OCR.OcrInput input = new Aspose.OCR.OcrInput(Aspose.OCR.InputType.SingleImage);
input.Add("source1.png");
input.Add("source2.jpg");
// Set recognition language
Aspose.OCR.RecognitionSettings recognitionSettings = new Aspose.OCR.RecognitionSettings();
recognitionSettings.Language = Aspose.OCR.Language.Ukr;
// Recognize image
List<Aspose.OCR.RecognitionResult> results = recognitionEngine.Recognize(input, recognitionSettings);
foreach(Aspose.OCR.RecognitionResult result in results)
{
	Console.WriteLine(result.RecognitionText);
}

```
