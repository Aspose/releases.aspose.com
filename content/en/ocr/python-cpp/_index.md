Extract text from images on any platform with our powerful and developer-friendly API for optical character recognition. You only need a few lines of Python code to add OCR capabilities into your Linux, MacOS, and Windows solutions. Analyze the data, create cloud services and serverless applications focusing on business task rather than complex maths, neural networks, and other technical intricacies.

## Aspose.OCR technology

Optical character recognition becomes a trivial and straightforward task with Aspose.OCR, even for developers new to the technology. It can convert virtually any file you can get from a scanner, camera, or download from web: scanned books, contracts, invoices, receipts, street photos, or screenshots. The accuracy and reliability of text recognition is guaranteed by an extensive range of both fully automated and manual image processing filters that enhance an image before it is sent to the OCR engine.

Powerful image processing and customizable content structure detection algorithms enable text extraction from virtually any image, ranging from high-quality scans to street photos. Multiple processing filters can be applied to the same image to get the best recognition quality.

## Key features

- Optical character recognition engine with superior recognition speed and accuracy.
- No pre-training or adaptation is necessary - the reliable results are guaranteed by Aspose engineering team.
- Supports 28 languages based on Latin, Cyrillic and Asian scrips.
- Detects and recognizes text in all popular typefaces and font styles.
- Accurately reads rotated, noisy and distorted images with the help of automatic processing filters.
- Supports a large number of image formats as well as bulk recognition of multiple images from an archive or folder.
- Recognizes the whole image or selected areas only.
- Recognition results are returned in the most popular data exchange formats.
- Full compatibility with other Aspose products - build solutions of any complexity using familiar concepts with minimal code.

## Supported file formats

- JPEG (.JPG or .JPEG)
- PNG (.PNG)
- PDF document (.PDF)
- TIFF (.TIF or .TIFF)
- Bitmap (.BMP)
- Archive (.ZIP)
- Public URL to JPEG, PNG, TIFF and BMP image.

**Note:** The URL must point directly to the image. The library cannot extract images from HTML pages and does not support authentication.

## Get started

You only need a few minutes and a basic knowledge of Python to create a basic OCR application:

```python
import sys
sys.path.append('./path/to/lib/asposeocr')

import asposeocr

settings = asposeocr.RecognitionSettings()
recognition_batch = [asposeocr.AsposeOCRInput()]
recognition_batch[0].url = 'scan.png'
recognition_result = AsposeOCRRecognize(recognition_batch, settings)
```
