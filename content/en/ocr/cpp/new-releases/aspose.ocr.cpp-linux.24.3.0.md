We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.OCR for C++ 24.3.0 Linux release. This release removes certain dependencies and simplifies integration.

### No ONNX Runtime Dependency

Linux developers can now link the ONNX Runtime library statically to eliminate the need for the separate `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime` dependency. This upgrade simplifies deployment and reduces potential compatibility issues.

### Supercharged Compatibility

Aspose.OCR for C++ 24.3.0 ensures seamless integration with your existing Linux-based C++ projects and optimizes compatibility.
