Aspose.OCR for C++ 24.3.0 is here, and it brings improvements and fixes to enhance your C++ OCR development experience. 

### No More ONNX Runtime Dependency

C++ developers can now statically link the ONNX Runtime library and eliminate the need for the separate `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime` dependency. This simplifies deployment and reduces potential compatibility issues.

### Improved Compatibility

With this update, we have ensured seamless integration with your existing C++ projects and optimized compatibility.
