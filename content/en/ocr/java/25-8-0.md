AsposeOCR api = new AsposeOCR();
// prepare rectangles with texts.
ArrayList rectArray = new ArrayList();
rectArray.add(new Rectangle(138, 352, 2033, 537));
rectArray.add(new Rectangle(147, 890, 2033, 1157));
String result = api.RecognizePage("template.png", rectArray);

System.out.println("Result with rect: " + result);
```
