[Product Page](https://products.aspose.com/ocr/java) | [Docs](https://docs.aspose.com/ocr/java/) | [Demos](https://products.aspose.app/ocr/family) | [API Reference](https://apireference.aspose.com/ocr/java) | [Examples](https://github.com/aspose-ocr/Aspose.OCR-for-Java) | [Blog](https://blog.aspose.com/category/ocr/) | [Search](https://search.aspose.com/) | [Free Support](https://forum.aspose.com/c/ocr) | [Temporary License](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license)

Aspose.OCR for Java offers a developer-friendly API for optical character recognition that can work an any platform that supports Java. With just a few lines of code, you can integrate OCR features into your desktop solutions and services that can work an any device. Extract text from scans, photos, and screenshots, convert scanned pages into searchable, indexable PDFs, and perform text search and comparison on images.

## Features and benefits

- **Global applications** - supporting over 130 languages, the library allows you to recognize texts in Latin, Cyrillic and Asian scrips.
- **Read everything** - retrieve text from any file obtained through a scanner or camera, and process images directly from web links.
- **Reliable results** - achieve the highest recognition accuracy for all images, including those that are out-of-focus, rotated, distorted, and noisy.
- **Batch processing** - bulk-recognize all images from folders and archives; read multi-page PDF documents, TIFF images and DjVu files.
- **Layout detection** - identify and categorize content blocks in images to ensure the correct order of extracted text, regardless of layout.
- **Suitable for any content** - image preprocessing and customizable document structure detection enable text extraction from virtually any image, ranging from high-quality scans to street photos.
- **Optimized** - the library balances recognition speed, quality, and resource utilization for each specific use case.
- **Easy to use** - you only need a few lines of code to convert image to text, create a searchable PDF, save recognition results to document, and many more.
- **Modular** - keep your application lean and modular by selectively adding advanced features from our [resource repository](https://github.com/aspose-ocr/resources).

### Supported file formats

- **.PDF** - Portable Document Format
- **.JPG** - JPEG, the most popular format for smartphone photos
- **.PNG** - Portable Network Graphics, 24-bit with transparency
- **.TIFF** - Tag Image File Format, commonly used for high quality scanning
- **.GIF** - Graphics Interchange Format, limited to 256 colors
- **.BMP** - Bitmap image file
- **.WBMP** - Monochrome graphics file optimized for mobile devices

Multi-page PDF documents and TIFF images are fully supported.

## Supported platforms

- **Microsoft Windows:** Windows Desktop & Server (both x86 and x64)
- **macOS**
- **Linux:** Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, CentOS, and other Linux distributives

## Convert image to text

```java
// Initialize Aspose.OCR recognition API
AsposeOCR api = new AsposeOCR();
RecognitionSettings recognitionSettings = new RecognitionSettings();
// Add image to the recognition batch
OcrInput source = new OcrInput(InputType.SingleImage);
source.add("image.png");
// Specify recognition language
RecognitionSettings recognitionSettings = new RecognitionSettings();
recognitionSettings.setLanguage(Language.ExtLatin);
// Extract text from image
ArrayList<RecognitionResult> results = api.Recognize(source, recognitionSettings);
System.out.println(result[0].recognition_text);
```
