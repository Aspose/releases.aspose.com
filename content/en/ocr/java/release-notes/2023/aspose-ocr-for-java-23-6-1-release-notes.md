The [release 23.3.0](https://docs.aspose.com/ocr/java/aspose-ocr-for-java-23-3-0-release-notes/) introduced a slimmer, faster and more straightforward API. All of your existing code will continue to work and you can even make minor updates to it, but be aware that all deprecated elements are scheduled to be removed in release **23.11.0 (November 2023)** in favor of the new API.
