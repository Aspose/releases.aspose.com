## What was changed

Key | Summary | Category
--- | ------- | --------
OCRJAVA-310<br />OCRJAVA-312 | Added a [preprocessing filter](https://docs.aspose.com/ocr/java/dewarp/) that corrects geometric distortions on an image.<br />See [**Added public APIs**](#preprocessingfilterautodewarping) for important details. | New feature

## Public API changes and backwards compatibility

This section lists all public API changes introduced in **Aspose.OCR for Java 23.2.0** that may affect the code of existing applications.

### Added public APIs:

The following public APIs have been introduced in this release:

#### `PreprocessingFilter.AutoDewarping()`

Aspose.OCR for the Java API has been extended with `PreprocessingFilter.AutoDewarping()` image preprocessing method that straightens severely curved and distorted images such as photographed pages from books, magazines, and the like. Such images are almost impossible to read by standard recognition algorithms.

{{% alert color="caution" %}}
In this release, the dewarping filter is not intended for bulk processing. It takes more than a minute and has some limitations.
We recommend using it for pinpoint processing of individual images that cannot be recognized otherwise.

**Important considerations**

- It is highly recommended to use [`DetectAreasMode.CURVED_TEXT`](https://docs.aspose.com/ocr/java/areas-detection/curved_text/) areas detection mode to extract text from the dewarped image. Other area detection modes may produce inaccurate results.
- [Automatic skew correction](https://docs.aspose.com/ocr/java/deskew/) must be turned off. Its combination with dewarping may result in severe image distortion.
- Due to the high complexity of the underlying neural network, dewarping requires significant system resources.

### Updated public APIs:

_No changes._

### Removed public APIs:

_No changes._

## Usage examples

The examples below illustrates the changes introduced in this release:

### Correct geometric distortions

```java
AsposeOCR api = new AsposeOCR();
RecognitionSettings settings = new RecognitionSettings();
// Apply dewarping filter
PreprocessingFilter filters = new PreprocessingFilter();
filters.add(PreprocessingFilter.AutoDewarping());
settings.setPreprocessingFilters(filters);
// Save dewarped image to file
BufferedImage image =  api.PreprocessImage(file, filters);
File outputSource = new File("result.png");
ImageIO.write(image, "png", outputSource);
// Extract text from image
RecognitionResult result = api.RecognizePage(file, settings);
System.out.println(result);
```
