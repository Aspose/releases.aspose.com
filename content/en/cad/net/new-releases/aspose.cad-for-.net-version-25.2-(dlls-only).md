#### Release Highlights

Aspose.CAD for .NET 25.2 (DLLs-only) delivers advanced CAD manipulation capabilities with new support for **stereo vision geometry**, improved **B-Spline surface reading**, **DXF export reliability**, and better **performance for image formats like JPEG**. Developers using DLL integrations can now access composite object parsers and embedded polyline + fill rendering enhancements.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Stereo Imaging APIs**  
  Compute essential/fundamental matrices, extract disparity maps, rectify stereo images, and generate point clouds from image pairs. [CADNET-9400‚Äì9402, CADNET-9398‚Äì9399]

- **Annotation Object Model Introduced**  
  Developers can now manipulate annotations in supported CAD documents. [CADNET-9083]

- **Polyline + Fill Rendering**  
  Enables correct display of overlapping geometry with both path and fill styles. [CADNET-10040]

- **Support for AcDb:AcDsPrototype_1b DWG Section**  
  Expanded parsing to new internal DWG structure. [CADNET-9851]

- **B-Spline Surface Interpretation**  
  3D curves and parametric surfaces are now correctly parsed. [CADNET-9921]

### üîß Enhancement

- **DWG to SVG Color Accuracy**  
  Corrects erroneous color translations on export. [CADNET-10025]

- **DXF Export Fixes**  
  Prevents generation of malformed DXF output from DWG. [CADNET-9214]

- **JPEG Export Optimization**  
  Reduced processing time for large CAD images. [CADNET-9580]

- **Modularization of U3D and 3DS Sources**  
  Improves performance and maintainability for format-specific workflows. [CADNET-9961, CADNET-9962]

- **Composite Object Parsing Added**  
  Adds interpretation of nested geometries and components. [CADNET-9963]

- **Better Compatibility in 3D PDF Rendering**  
  Enhanced appearance across non-Acrobat viewers. [CADNET-9377]

- **Mesh Visibility Fix in DWG to 3DS**  
  Prevents invisible output from valid geometry. [CADNET-9559]
