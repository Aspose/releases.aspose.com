# Better Acrobat Reader&reg; & Foxit&reg; Line Rendering

Previously in some instances the lines were missing for Acrobat Reader&reg; but were present in the Foxit&reg;. This issue has now been resolved.

# Support for AutoCAD&reg; DXB Format

Implemented and introduced the support for the AutoCAD&reg; DXB file format. `DXB` typically stores the 3D CAD drawings. `DXB` is the binary version of `DXF` file.

# Improved DWF to PDF Conversion

Previously in some instances while converting DWF to PDF did not convert all pages correct. This issue has now been resolved.
