Upgrade your C# apps with the latest Aspose.CAD for .NET 24.2 (MSI installer) release! This release equips developers with improved DWG/DWF processing capabilities, new export options, and more.

### Enhanced DWG/DWF Processing

The latest CAD API update offers improved handling of blind watermarks in DWF files, support for reading CFB format files, and better extraction of BMP images from OLE streams.

### New Export Options

You can directly export DWF files to DWF as well as DWFX files to DWF using the ePlot interface in Aspose.CAD for .NET 24.2.

### Improved Rendering and Conversion

With this .NET API version, we have added enhanced support for dashed line styles, SHX fonts, 3D model positioning in PDFs, and SVG to DWG/OBJ conversion.

### More Improvements and Fixes

Various enhancements and issues related to parallel DWF to PDF conversion, dimension background fill implementation, and DWG/DWF file opening and saving have been resolved.
