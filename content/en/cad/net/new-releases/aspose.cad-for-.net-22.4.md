# Better Memory Management

Memory leak was observed while converting AutoCAD&reg; DXF to TIFF (raster graphics) format. So this release of the API offers a better memory management for DXF to TIFF Conversion.

# Improved DWG to WMF Export

Improved the export of AutoCAD&reg; `DWG` to `WMF` (Windows Metafile).

# Export Embedded Image

Ability to export image from embedded image data.

# Improved `DWG` Rendering

It was observed that the `DWG` was being rendered without colors. This issue has now been resolved within this release of the API.
