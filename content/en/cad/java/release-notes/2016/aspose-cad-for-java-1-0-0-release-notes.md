We are pleased to announce the first release of Aspose.CAD for Java. It allows you to convert AutoCAD DWG and DXF files to PDF and Raster images. It is a native API and does not require AutoCAD or any other software to be installed.

You can also convert the selected layers and layouts from the AutoCAD files. The conversion to PDF and Raster images is of very high quality. At the moment we support the following Cad image types for loading (please refer to the <https://autodesk.blogs.com/between_the_lines/autocad-release-history.html> DWG file history):
o CadR11
o CadR13
o CadR14
o CadR2000
o CadR2004
o CadR2010
o CadR2013

### **Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes**
Please note that Aspose.CAD API was split from Aspose.Imaging API, hence its public API is almost the same so you can easily migrate to Aspose.CAD by renaming the packages to com.aspose.cad instead of com.aspose.imaging. Following is an example to convert CAD documents to PDF using Aspose.Imaging and Aspose.CAD respectively. You can notice that just com.aspose.imaging package has been replaced with com.aspose.cad.
###### **Aspose.Imaging Code**
{{< highlight java >}}

 String sourceFilePath = myDir + "sample.dxf";

//Load a CAD drawing

com.aspose.imaging.Image image = com.aspose.imaging.Image.load(sourceFilePath);

//Create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions and set its various properties

com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions();

rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(1600);

rasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(1600);

//Create an instance of PdfOptions

com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.PdfOptions pdfOptions = new com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.PdfOptions();

//Set the VectorRasterizationOptions property

pdfOptions.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);

//Export the DXF to PDF

image.save(myDir + "result.pdf", pdfOptions);

###### **Aspose.CAD Code**
{{< highlight java >}}

  // The path to the resource directory.

 String dataDir = Utils.getDataDir(ExportDXFDrawingToPDF.class) + "DXFDrawings/";

 String srcFile = dataDir + "conic_pyramid.dxf";

 com.aspose.cad.Image image = com.aspose.cad.Image.load(srcFile);

 // Create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions and set its various properties

 com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.CadRasterizationOptions();

 rasterizationOptions.setBackgroundColor(Color.getWhite());

 rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(1600);

 rasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(1600);

 // Create an instance of PdfOptions

 com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfOptions pdfOptions = new com.aspose.cad.imageoptions.PdfOptions();

 // Set the VectorRasterizationOptions property

 pdfOptions.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);

 // Export the DXF to PDF

 image.save(dataDir + "conic_pyramid_out_.pdf", pdfOptions);
