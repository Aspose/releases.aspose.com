  Addressed multiple cases where SHX fonts failed to render, especially for Java-based exports and older DXF/DWG files.

- **LoadOptions Stability Fixes**  
  Resolved `NullReferenceException` when using default `LoadOptions` instance.

- **STEP Format Enriched**  
  Extended STEP file parsing to include enhanced 3D primitives.
