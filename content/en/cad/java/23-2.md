# What's new in the Aspose.CAD for Java 23.2

## Release Highlights

Aspose.CAD for Java 23.2 enhances raster and vector export reliability for DWG, DXF, DWF, and IFC formats. This release fixes major rendering defects, improves Azure and Linux platform support, and adds better control over page sizing and dashed line visibility.

## Enhancements

- **DWG Export in Azure Function Fixed**  
  Addressed failures when saving DWG as JPG in Azure serverless environments.

- **Improved DXF and DWF Export Stability**  
  - Fixed black square rendering for DWF files.
  - Corrected corrupted DXF outputs and exception scenarios during save operations.

- **OLE Image Restoration**  
  Resolved regression issue where OLE images disappeared between versions 22.7 and 22.10.

- **IFC Rendering on Linux Corrected**  
  Eliminated black-image outputs for IFC file rendering in Linux environments.

- **Paper Space and Dashed Lines Restored**  
  - Fixed missing elements on DXF/DWG paper space pages.
  - Dashed lines now render properly in raster outputs.

- **Memory Leak Eliminated**  
  Resolved excessive memory usage during DXF to TIFF conversions.

- **Page Size Settings Honored**  
  `PageWidth` and `PageHeight` are now correctly applied when exporting DWG to PDF.

- **DimensionFromScratch Unification**  
  Unified internal dimension handling across different types for more predictable layout rendering.

- **Image Size Flag Handling Improved**  
  Corrected rendering inconsistencies caused by `UpdateSize` flags during raster export.
