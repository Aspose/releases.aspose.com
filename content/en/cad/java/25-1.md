# What's new in the Aspose.CAD for Java 25.1

## Release Highlights

Aspose.CAD for Java 25.1 brings major enhancements, including blind watermark embedding for GLTF/GLB formats, initial support for PostScript files, and improved vectorization using the Douglas-Peucker algorithm. This release also addresses SVG layering, DWG/DXF block attributes, and multiple format compatibility issues across environments.

## Enhancements

- **Watermarking Enhancements**
  - Implemented blind watermark support for GLB and GLTF formats.
  - Enabled watermark embedding, extraction, and removal features.
  - Adapted blind watermark service for multiple save modes.

- **Format Support and Interoperability**
  - Added initial support for PostScript format.
  - Improved float parsing for diverse format standards.
  - Enhanced reading of layer information from SVG.
  - Fixed “Image loading failed” for IGS files and DGN drawing import issues.

- **DWG/DXF Feature Enhancements**
  - Completed parsing of AcDbAssoc classes for DWG.
  - Fixed missing ATTRIBs on DWG export when modified.
  - Enabled block attributes read/write operations.

- **GLTF/GLB and Rendering**
  - Improved facet color support in GLTF/GLB exports.
  - Resolved validation and binary component issues in GLTF to SVG conversions.
  - Enhanced performance of OBJ renderer and GLTF-to-OBJ conversions.

- **Vectorization and Layouts**
  - Introduced solid bold line rendering instead of contours in vectorization (via custom load options).
  - Added support for vertex grouping via Douglas-Peucker algorithm.
  - Added ability to read page rotation angle from DWF.

- **Bug Fixes and Stability**
  - Fixed false validation errors in GLTF/GLB outputs.
  - Resolved rendering issues with STP and DXF exports.
  - Addressed VerifyError regression and Docker-specific “Parameter is invalid” issue.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- No breaking changes to the public API in this release.
