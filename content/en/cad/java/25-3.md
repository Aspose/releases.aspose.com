# What's new in the Aspose.CAD for Java 25.3

## Release Highlights

Aspose.CAD for Java 25.3 introduces advanced DXF and GLB enhancements, including improved hatch and polyline writing for DXF 2018, color fixes in DWG to GLB, and robust triangulation for B-Spline surfaces. This release also adds support for 3D scaling in multiple formats and implements Arnold transformation for watermark scrambling. Performance, multithreading, and memory usage optimizations have been made, along with initial support for Navisworks File Set (.nwf).

## Enhancements

- **File Format Enhancements**
  - Fixed missing colors during DWG to GLB conversion.
  - Improved DXF 2018 compatibility with enhanced Hatch and LWPolyline writing.
  - Enhanced triangulation logic for B-Spline surfaces and STP surface rendering.
  - Fixed incorrect or empty conversions between GLB, DXF, DWG, and STP formats.

- **Watermarking Improvements**
  - Implemented watermark generation and scrambling using the Arnold transformation algorithm.

- **3D Scaling Support**
  - Added 3D scale support across DXF, OBJ, and FBX formats.

- **Framework and Compatibility**
  - Enabled usage in OSGi environments.
  - Removed legacy Xamarin build dependencies.
  - Improved on-the-fly rendering to reduce memory consumption.

- **Editing and Export**
  - Introduced capability to edit DXF files directly.
  - Resolved export issues with DICOM, WEBP, and EMF formats.

- **Stability and Performance**
  - Fixed multithreading conflict: "Item has already been added."
  - Merged MText rendering improvements.
  - Addressed slow processing and high CPU usage on Java runtime.

## New Features

- **Navisworks File Set (.nwf) Support**
  - Added initial support for parsing and handling `.nwf` format files.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- No breaking changes in this release.
