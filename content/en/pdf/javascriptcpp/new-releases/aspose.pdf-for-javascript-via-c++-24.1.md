### Effortless TXT to PDF Conversion

Aspose.PDF for JavaScript via C++ 24.1 includes the `AsposePdfFromTxt` API which simplifies the process of converting plain text (.TXT) files into well-formatted PDF documents using your JavaScript applications on any platform.

### Seamless Attachment Management

The JS PDF library introduces two new APIs in the latest release: `AsposePdfAddAttachment` and `AsposePdfGetAttachment`. These functions enable you to effortlessly add attachments to existing PDF files and retrieve attachments from them within your JavaScript code.
