This page contains release notes for [Aspose.PDF for .NET 5.2.0](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/new-releases/aspose.pdf-for-.net-5.2.0/)

{{% /alert %}}

We are glad to announce the release of another version of Aspose.PDF for .NET. Some of the issues reported earlier have been fixed along with the introduction of some new features such as ignoring unrecognized CSS tags when converting HTML to PDF, creation of transparent form field, compatibility of product with Mono and a very high demanding feature of converting SVG files into PDF format, have been added in this new release.
