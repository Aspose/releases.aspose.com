Introduction

In this release, the feature 'PDF Linearization' (sometimes called 'Web Optimized' or 'Fast Web View') is supported. The idea behind linearization is faster display of PDF documents downloaded from the web. If you're developing a Web-based system that creates large PDF files for delivery to web browsers over the Internet, you should try to make sure that your system can generate linearized PDF files. As your users might become frustrated and impatient if your system creates large PDF files that are not linearized. In addition, we have optimized the performance and memory usage for large table processing. Mirror margin feature in MS Word is supported when converting doc into PDF. Importing PDF file into Corel Draw is also supported in this release. Besides, some bugs are fixed.
