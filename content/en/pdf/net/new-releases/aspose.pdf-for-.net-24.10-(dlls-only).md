#### Release Highlights

Aspose.PDF for .NET 24.10 (DLLs Only) enhances digital signing, drawing safety, and layout accuracy with new ECDSA support, HTML/CSS rendering improvements, and advanced image placement tools.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **ECDSA Digital Signature Support**: Enables secure document signing using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm.

### üîß Enhancement

- **CSS Underline in HTML Output**: Underline styles are now accurately rendered using CSS during PDF-to-HTML conversion.
- **Image Insertion with Cropping**: Insert and crop images using new `Page.AddImage()` overloads that accept both source and destination rectangles.

### üõ† Fix

- Resolved wide-ranging issues affecting rendering, conversion, and form processing:
  - Incorrect results in PDF to Image (JPG, PNG, TIFF) and XPS conversion (font, transparency)
  - Content loss, glyph mapping issues, and HTML rendering bugs
  - Errors during PDF/A, PDFA-2a, PDFA-1b conversion and signature validation
- Fixed API stability and behavior:
  - Memory leaks, performance degradation, incorrect exceptions
  - Improved `TextAbsorber.Visit()` indexing and layout conformity for Arabic and stamped content

### üîÅ Public API & Backwards Incompatible Changes

- **Drawing Enhancements**:
  - `CheckBounds(double, double)` methods for shape validation (Arc, Curve, Ellipse, Path, Rectangle, etc.)
  - `Graph.Shapes` now uses `BoundsCheckableList<Shape>` instead of `List<Shape>`
- **Image Insertion Updates**:
  - `Page.AddImage()` now supports source cropping rectangle
- **New API Types**:
  - `BoundsCheckMode`, `BoundsOutOfRangeException`, `IBoundsCheckableItem`, `BoundsCheckableList<T>`
- **Removed API**:
  - `Page.AddImage()` overloads without source rectangle
  - `Rectangle.Contains(Point)` overload removed
