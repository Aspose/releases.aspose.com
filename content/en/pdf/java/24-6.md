# What's new in the Aspose.PDF for Java 24.6

## Release Highlights

Aspose.PDF for Java 24.6 delivers vital features for document metadata management, paragraph content replacement, and text extraction control. This release introduces PDF v2.0 metadata setters, ODS vertical alignment handling, and support for external signature decoding, extending PDF accessibility and security in enterprise workflows.

## New Features

- **External Signature Decoding Support:**
  - Signing PDFs using external certificates now includes enhanced decoding for improved security and integration flexibility.

- **PDF v2.0 Metadata Setters:**
  - Developers can now access and modify XMP metadata using new `Metadata.getItem()` and `setItem()` methods, aligning with the PDF 2.0 specification.

## Enhancements

- **ODS Export Vertical Alignment:**
  - More accurate rendering of cell content alignment during PDF to ODS conversions.

- **Paragraph-Level Text Replacement:**
  - Use `ParagraphAbsorber` in combination with `TextReplaceOptions` to target and replace paragraph content precisely.

- **Text Absorption Area Control:**
  - Ability to define restricted areas for `TextAbsorber`, ensuring sensitive content is excluded from extraction.

- **Standardization of Enum Values:**
  - Over 60 internal constants converted into Java-native `enum` types for a more intuitive and safe API.

## Bug Fixes

- **Layout and Format Corrections:**
  - Fixed various DOCX and Excel conversion issues, including misaligned bullet points, incorrect cell spacing, and improperly merged tables.
  - Resolved longstanding issues related to bidirectional text (e.g., Arabic rendered in LTR format).

- **Content Rendering and Extraction:**
  - Improved HTML to PDF conversion fidelity, especially around list formatting and missing/overlapping content.
  - Restored accurate text fragment detection with `TextAbsorber`.

- **Memory and Platform Compatibility:**
  - Fixed memory errors during JPEG processing.
  - Addressed rendering inconsistencies on Linux for image export.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

### Added Methods

- Metadata handling: `Metadata.getItem(String)`, `setItem(String, XmpValue)`
- Image accessibility: `ImageStamp.getAlternativeText()`
- SaveOptions: `isCacheGlyphs()` and `setCacheGlyphs(boolean)`
- Paragraph editing: `ParagraphAbsorber.getTextReplaceOptions()`

### Added Classes

- `Document.RepairOptions` for advanced document diagnostics
- `facades.BDCProperties` for logical structure element tagging

### Enum Conversion (Selected List)

The following classes are now enums:
- `BorderStyle`, `ColorSpace`, `Direction`, `HighlightingMode`, `Justification`, `PageLayout`, `PasswordType`, `ShapeType` — promoting safer and cleaner coding standards.
