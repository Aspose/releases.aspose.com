# What's new in the Aspose.PDF for Java 23.8

## Release Highlights

Aspose.PDF for Java 23.8 delivers powerful new features including support for shape extraction, detection of text overflow, and recognition of incremental updates in PDFs. Additionally, this release improves PDF/A compliance, vector graphic processing, and layout accuracy during DOCX/XLSX conversions.

## New Features

- **Shape Extraction Support:**
  - Introduced new vector graphics extraction API via `GraphicsAbsorber` and related classes for extracting and analyzing shape data from PDFs.
- **Text Overflow Detection:**
  - Added API to detect overflow when inserting text into limited layout spaces.
- **Incremental Save Detection:**
  - Allows detection of fast save data (incremental updates) within existing PDF files.
- **OutputIntent Transfer:**
  - Now copies OutputIntents from input PDF to output during merging or conversion.

## Enhancements

- **PDF to DOCX/XLSX Accuracy:**
  - Improved layout consistency and handling of merged cells and split tables.
- **PDF/A Conversion Reliability:**
  - Fixed several PDF/A 2a/2b/3b compliance issues, especially on Linux environments.
- **Grayscale Conversion Fixes:**
  - Resolved inaccuracies during color-to-grayscale rendering.
- **Resource Optimization Stability:**
  - Fixed element distortion introduced by `Document.optimizeResources()`.

## Bug Fixes

- **Merged or Split Table Elements:**
  - Corrected improper cell merging or row splitting during DOCX/XLSX conversion.
- **Vector Rendering Issues:**
  - Improved layout rendering in vector-heavy documents including grayscale handling.
- **PDF/A Non-Compliance Errors:**
  - Fixed multiple non-compliance exceptions during PDFA3b and PDFA2a/b conversion (including Linux).
