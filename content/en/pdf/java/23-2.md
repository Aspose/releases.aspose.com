# What's new in the Aspose.PDF for Java 23.2

## Release Highlights

Aspose.PDF for Java 23.2 delivers a major upgrade by replacing legacy int-based enums with standard Java enums across multiple APIs. It also improves underline detection and resolves layout consistency issues in PDF to DOCX conversions.

## Enhancements

- **Underline Detection Improved**
  - Enhanced ability to recognize underlined text accurately in PDFs.
- **Standard Java Enums Introduced**
  - Replaced legacy int-based enums in various packages with type-safe `enum` classes for cleaner, modern code and reduced bugs.

## Bug Fixes

- **PDF to DOCX Conversion Fixes:**
  - Resolved issues with extra lines, missing underlines, text overlapping images, incorrect text alignment, extra columns, merged lines, and shifted margins.
  - Fixed visual inconsistencies like misplaced text, double top borders, and incorrect table border colors.
- **Watermark and Rendering Fixes:**
  - Fixed opacity increase in watermarks across pages.
  - Corrected behavior of `setDraw()` and improved watermark consistency.
- **PDF Security and Form Fixes:**
  - Eliminated encryption issues and improved annotation handling in `PdfAnnotationEditor` and `PdfFileSecurity`.
  - Improved font handling in `FormattedText`.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

- **New Class:**
  - `com.aspose.pdf.PsSaveOptions` – Enables saving PDFs in PostScript format.
- **New Methods:**
  - `Page.trySaveVectorGraphics(String)`
  - `TableAbsorber.visit(IDocument)`
  - Overloaded constructors for `TextEditOptions` and `TextReplaceOptions`.
- **New Image Formats:**
  - `ImageFormat.MemoryBmp`, `Wmf`, and `Exif`.
- **Enums Modernization:**
  - Dozens of enums such as `FontStyle`, `HorizontalAlignment`, `VerticalAlignment`, `FieldType`, `FormType`, `AnnotationType`, etc., migrated to type-safe `enum` declarations.
- **Updated Method Signatures:**
  - All related setter/getter methods and constructors updated to use new enums (e.g., `setAlignment(HorizontalAlignment)` instead of `int`).
