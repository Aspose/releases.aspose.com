# What's new in the Aspose.PDF for Java 24.9

## Release Highlights

Aspose.PDF for Java 24.9 introduces advanced capabilities for accessible document generation, graphical PDF comparison, and precision control over document versions. This release also resolves multiple bugs related to layout, text handling, and format conversion, significantly improving document fidelity and performance.

## New Features

- **Create Accessible PDFs Using Low-Level Functions:**  
  Developers can now generate accessible PDFs (tagged PDFs) using granular, low-level APIs to meet compliance standards such as PDF/UA.
  
- **Graphical Comparison of PDF Documents:**  
  A new feature allows graphical comparison of PDF files, offering pixel-level analysis to detect visual differences between documents.

- **Immediate Document Instance Creation with PDF Version 2.0:**  
  The API now supports instant creation of a `Document` object with specified PDF versions, including version 2.0, allowing better format control from the start.

## Enhancements

- **File Size Optimization Insight:**  
  Improved diagnostics explain why optimized PDF files may remain large relative to embedded images, enhancing transparency for developers managing file compression.

## Bug Fixes

- **Improved Bullet List Recognition in Chinese PDFs:**  
  Fixed an issue where bullet lists were not detected during PDF to DOCX conversion.

- **Custom CMYK Conversion Fix:**  
  Addressed problems with CMYK conversions using custom color profiles, ensuring accurate color reproduction.

- **PDF/A-2 Compliance Issue:**  
  Resolved compatibility issues when saving documents in PDF/A-2 format.

- **Hidden Layer Access Restored:**  
  Fixed an issue preventing access to hidden layers in PDF documents.

- **Mathematical Equation Extraction Fix:**  
  Corrected extraction logic to prevent garbage characters in place of mathematical content.

- **Dynamic XFA Form Conversion to AcroForm:**  
  Addressed a failure in converting dynamic XFA forms into standard AcroForms.

- **Text Truncation During Replacement:**  
  Fixed `TextReplaceOptions()` to prevent cutoff in output text after replacements.

- **Split Operation Bug:**  
  Resolved PDF corruption issues that occurred when splitting documents.
