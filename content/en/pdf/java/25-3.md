# What's new in the Aspose.PDF for Java 25.3

## Release Highlights

Aspose.PDF for Java 25.3 introduces a powerful plugin-based architecture for PDF manipulation, signature verification enhancements, and comprehensive form editing capabilities. This release also includes support for brainpool curve ECDSA signing, detection of compromised digital signatures, and a wide array of performance and rendering bug fixes.

## New Features

- **High Code Plugin APIs Integrated:**  
  A new plugin system allows modular execution of tasks like PDF merging, form editing, optimization, conversion, image extraction, and digital signing.

- **Digital Signature Compromise Detection:**  
  The API now supports advanced detection for tampered or compromised digital signatures, enhancing security and trust.

- **Support for DSA and Brainpool Curves in ECDSA Signing:**  
  Expanded signing algorithm support includes brainpool curve types and resolves compatibility with specific private key types.

## Enhancements

- **Security and Cryptography Enhancements:**
  - Updated Bouncy Castle to resolve critical v1.54 vulnerabilities.
  - Improved ECDSA signature compatibility and private key access handling.

- **Expanded PDF/X and PDF/A Validation Support:**  
  Improved handling of edge cases in PDF/A-1b and other archival formats, ensuring standards compliance.

- **Widget Annotation and Layout Enhancements:**
  - Enhanced structure tagging and layout positioning through new `PositionSettings` APIs.
  - Improved field form creation/editing via plugin models.

## Bug Fixes

- **Digital Signature Issues:**
  - Resolved regressions where private keys were inaccessible or signatures failed validation in v25.2.
  - Fixed `NONEwithRSA` support errors for certain private keys.

- **Conversion and Optimization Fixes:**
  - PDF to Excel: Cell misalignment and title splitting issues resolved.
  - PDF to DOCX: Bullet and padding misinterpretation corrected.
  - PDF/A: Prevented content loss during optimization and resolved validation problems.

- **Form and Rendering Fixes:**
  - Addressed formatting errors in XFA form filling.
  - Restored bookmark preservation after PDF re-save.
  - Fixed SVG icon rendering and base64 image conversion hangs in HTML inputs.
  - Corrected DOCX conversion bugs on Ubuntu and misalignment in PCL to PDF conversions.

- **Regression Fixes:**
  - Fixed `NullPointerException` during merging in versions post 23.8.
  - Resolved broken `ExternalSignature` support in version 25.2.

## Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes

**Renamed Classes and Methods:**
- `PageCollectionExtension` → `PageCollectionExtensions`
- `TextFragmentState.getStrikeOut()` → `isStrikeOut()`
- `TextState.getStrikeOut()` → `isStrikeOut()`

**Added Classes:**
- Extensive list under `com.aspose.pdf.plugins` for:
  - PDF merging, optimization, image conversion, text extraction, signing, form editing, security, table building, HTML conversion, and more.

**Added Methods:**
- `PageCollectionExtensions.addPagination(...)`, `addBatesNumbering(...)`, `deleteBatesNumbering(...)`
- Signature and structure element enhancements across tagged logical structure modules.
- Extended methods for digital signature object manipulation and plugin-specific actions.

**Added Constructors:**
- `BDCProperties(String)` and `BDCProperties(Integer[], String)`

**Removed Deprecated Methods:**
- From `OptimizationOptions`, `MCRElement`, and tagged logical elements, including hyperlink, image settings, and content management.

**New Field:**
- `MCRElement.Handler`

**Deprecated APIs:**
- Marked `StructureTextState.setMarginInfo()` and `getHorizontalAlignment()` as deprecated for replacement by newer layout APIs.
