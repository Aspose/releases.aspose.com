# What's new in the Aspose.PDF for Java 24.11

## Release Highlights

Aspose.PDF for Java 24.11 introduces critical updates to PDF/A compliance handling, annotation rendering, and document conversions. This release addresses a broad range of issues including HTML to PDF inaccuracies, DOCX export glitches, and cryptographic enhancements. New APIs extend support for signature algorithms, regex management, and logical structure manipulation.

## Enhancements

- **PDF/A Conversion Optimization:**  
  Improved handling of `PdfFormat.PDF_A_3B` to reduce file size increase during conversion, enhancing compliance performance without compromising output quality.

## Bug Fixes

- **DOCX Conversion Enhancements:**
  - Fixed issues where table headers were split across lines or content shifted to incorrect pages.
  - Corrected missing underline formatting and inconsistent content placement.

- **PDF/A and Resizing Issues:**
  - Fixed errors that caused unreadable or non-loadable resized files in Adobe Acrobat.
  - Addressed compliance problems with `PDF/A_3U` and `PDF/A_2B` standards.
  - Resolved bug causing faded or unreadable characters when extracting document pages.

- **HTML to PDF Improvements:**
  - Fixed text truncation, misplaced content, and formatting issues in Hebrew and bidirectional text.
  - Addressed Java 17 compatibility and image source issues, preventing conversion failures.
  - Improved handling of line breaks, hyperlinks, and extra spacing.

- **Annotations and Graphics:**
  - Resolved a Mac OS-specific annotation rendering bug where rectangles appeared crossed.
  - Fixed alignment issues in highlight annotations.

- **Other Conversion Fixes:**
  - Fixed PNG export failures and markdown conversion exceptions.
  - Resolved table heading alignment bugs.
  - Eliminated null reference and rendering problems in several formats.

## Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes

**Added Classes:**
- `com.aspose.pdf.CryptographicStandard`
- `com.aspose.pdf.RegexManager`

**Added Constructors:**
- `ExternalSignature(X509Certificate2, DigestHashAlgorithm)`
- `ExternalSignature(String, DigestHashAlgorithm)`
- `PKCS7Detached(InputStream, DigestHashAlgorithm)`
- `PKCS7Detached(String, String, DigestHashAlgorithm)`
- `PKCS7Detached(DigestHashAlgorithm)`

**Added Methods:**
- `PdfFileSignature.getSignaturesInfo()`
- `GraphInfo.getX()` / `getY()`
- `Signature.getSignatureAlgorithmInfo()`
- `SignHash.invoke(byte[], DigestHashAlgorithm)`
- Logical structure enhancements including:
  - `Element.appendChild(Element, boolean)`
  - `Element.insertChild(Element, int, boolean)`
  - `StructureElement.changeParentElement(StructureElement, boolean)`
  - `StructureElement.removeAndMoveItsChildObjectsToItsParent()`

**Removed Methods:**
- `CurveTo.getPoints()`
- Deprecated methods in `OptimizationOptions` and outdated `addImage()` overloads.

**Marked Deprecated:**
- `OptimizationOptions.setLinkDuplcateStreams(boolean)`
- `OptimizationOptions.getLinkDuplcateStreams()`

**Renamed Methods:**
- Getter methods in `OptimizationOptions` now use `is` prefix for boolean properties (e.g., `getAllowReusePageContent()` → `isAllowReusePageContent()`).

**Added Fields:**
- Curve control points: `CurveTo.X1`, `Y1`, `X2`, `Y2`, `X3`, `Y3`

**Replaced:**
- Replaced `ExternalSignature.getCertificate()` with public field `ExternalSignature#Certificate`
