TextAbsorber textAbsorber = new TextAbsorber();

// Accept the absorber for all the pages
pdfDocument.getPages().accept(textAbsorber);

// Get the extracted text
String extractedText = textAbsorber.getText();

// Create a writer and open the file
java.io.FileWriter writer = new java.io.FileWriter(new java.io.File("Extracted_text.txt"));
