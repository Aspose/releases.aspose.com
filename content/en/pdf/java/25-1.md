# What's new in the Aspose.PDF for Java 25.1

## Release Highlights

Aspose.PDF for Java 25.1 brings key advancements in digital signing, font substitution, and compliance customization. This release addresses slowdowns in annotation processing, enhances SHA256/SHA512 signing, and introduces powerful APIs for privilege management and PDF/X-1a ICC profiling. Numerous bug fixes also target HTML rendering, image conversion, and PDF/A attachment integrity.

## New Features

- **RSA Provider Compatibility Enhancement:**  
  Support for environments where `NONEwithRSA` is not universally available across Java providers, ensuring broader compatibility.

- **Document Privileges Inspection:**  
  New functionality to retrieve detailed document privilege settings (e.g., printing, copying), aiding security audits and compliance checks.

- **Font Substitution When Installed:**  
  Now detects and uses suitable installed fonts even when embedded fonts are missing, improving rendering consistency without manual intervention.

- **Output Intent Customization for PDF/X-1a:**  
  Introduced support for setting custom ICC profiles when converting to PDF/X-1a, helping meet specific print and archival standards.

## Enhancements

- **Annotation Flatten Performance Optimization:**  
  Resolved significant slowdowns in `Annotation.flatten()` noted since version 24.09, restoring expected performance for large files.

- **General Processing Speed Improvements:**  
  Addressed multiple cases of performance degradation during file manipulation.

- **SHA256 and SHA512 Signing:**  
  Strengthened document security by allowing use of SHA256 or SHA512 hashes in digital signatures, aligning with modern cryptographic best practices.

## Bug Fixes

- **Digital Signature Fixes:**
  - Addressed signature verification failures under specific configurations.
  - Fixed issues where setting privileges before signing caused signature invalidation.

- **HTML to PDF Rendering Issues:**
  - Corrected multiple layout problems including word wrap, word break, and table-cell alignment.
  - Resolved content loss and formatting errors in HTML fragments and MHT conversions.
  - Fixed exceptions thrown during HTML processing.

- **Underline and Text Style Extraction:**
  - Improved recognition and extraction of underline, strikethrough, subscript, and superscript formatting.

- **PDF/A Compliance Fixes:**
  - Ensured attachments retain PDF/A conformance.
  - Fixed compliance issues in converted files.

- **Other Resolved Issues:**
  - PNG output now correctly renders images.
  - EPS image insertion now works without null pointer exceptions.
  - Resolved issues with `NullPointerException` on saving PDFs and during concatenation processes.

## Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes

**Added Methods:**
- `ExternalSignature(X509Certificate, PrivateKey, DigestHashAlgorithm)`
- `PdfFileSignature.verifySignature(String, ValidationOptions, ValidationResult[])`
- `FloatingBox.getPositioningMode()`
- `FloatingBox.setPositioningMode(ParagraphPositioningMode)`
- `OcspSettings.getRequestTimeout()` / `.setRequestTimeout(int)`
- `Signature.getCustomSign()` / `.setCustomSign(CustomSign)`
- `Signature.verify(ValidationOptions, ValidationResult[])`

**Added Classes:**
- `com.aspose.pdf.CustomSign`
- `com.aspose.pdf.ParagraphPositioningMode`

**Added Fields:**
- `HtmlSaveOptions.RasterImagesSavingModes.DontSave`
- `TeXLoadResult.InvalidResult`

**Method Changes:**
- Removed the `boolean` parameter from:
  - `Field.flatten(boolean)` → `Field.flatten()`
  - `RedactionAnnotation.flatten(boolean)` → `RedactionAnnotation.flatten()`
