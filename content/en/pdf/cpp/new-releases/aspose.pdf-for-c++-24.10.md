#### Release Highlights

Aspose.PDF for C++ 24.10 on Windows introduces support for importing CorelDRAW (.CDR) files, adds `CheckBounds()` validation for shape layouts, and provides `BoundsCheckableList` for structured drawing operations. The update enhances rendering control and crash diagnostics in Windows-based environments.

#### New Feature

- **CDR File Import**: Load **CorelDRAW (.CDR)** files directly into PDF using `CdrLoadOptions`.
- **Shape Bounds Checking**: Use `CheckBounds()` methods on `Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Path`, and more to ensure layout compliance.
- **BoundsCheckableList**: Safely manage drawable items within container bounds using this new structure.
- **CrashReportOptions API**: Add structured crash diagnostics with custom messages and save paths.
- **Rectangle::Contains Overload**: Improved precision with optional strict containment logic.

#### Enhancement

- **Stream-Based Image Handling**: New `AddImage()` overloads now support streams, HOCR, and bounding box control.
- **PDF Version Selection**: Instantiate documents with specific `PdfVersion` settings.
- **Matrix Flipping Utility**: Added `Matrix::GetFlipMatrix()` for mirrored rendering in complex transformations.

#### Fix

- Removed legacy `AddImage()` methods and generic shape lists to ensure safe rendering logic.
- Refined layout validation for Windows-based file handling and PDF rendering performance.
