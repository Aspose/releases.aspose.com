#### Release Highlights

Aspose.PDF for C++ 25.4 on Windows introduces robust enhancements for PDF generation and conversion, including a critical Markdown rendering fix, new AutoTagging strategies, and advanced security encryption hooks. Developers can now customize layout tagging and encryption flows with more precision.

#### New Feature

- **Markdown Fix**: Resolved `NullReferenceException` when converting PDFs to Markdown format.
- **AutoTaggingSettings API**: Added intelligent tagging control with `HeadingRecognitionStrategy`, `HeadingLevels`, and `EnableAutoTagging`.
- **Encryption Extensibility**:
  - Implement custom encryption logic with `ICustomSecurityHandler` interface.
  - Extract full encryption info using `EncryptionParameters`.
- **TextState Enhancements**: New boolean flags to check/set styling properties like font, spacing, alignment, colors, invisibility, and underline.
- **License Reset**: New `License::ClearLicense()` API for unbinding license settings.
- **MarkdownSaveOptions Updates**: Added getter/setter for `HeadingStyle` to manage heading conversions more accurately.

#### Enhancement

- AutoTagging and logical structure customization through `PdfFormatConversionOptions::get_AutoTaggingSettings()`.
- Tagged content pre-save lifecycle control with `ITaggedContent::PreSave()` and `Save()` methods.

#### Fix

- Removed deprecated `PdfToMarkdown::HeadingLevels` and updated namespace access to centralized types.
