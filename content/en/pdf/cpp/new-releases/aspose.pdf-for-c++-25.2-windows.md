#### Release Highlights

Aspose.PDF for C++ 25.2 on Windows introduces support for PDF/X-4, an advanced low-level dictionary API for PDF structure manipulation, and enhanced font handling during HTML export. This version enhances stamping, signing, and memory-safe PDF rendering on Windows.

#### New Feature

- **CosPdfDictionary API**: Read, modify, and iterate over PDF dictionaries with `CosPdfDictionary` and its key/value primitives.
- **New PDF Conformance**: Added support for `PdfFormat::PDF_X_4`.
- **Signature Metadata**:
  - Introduced `SignatureName` for accessing name/identity of a signature.
  - `SignatureLengthMismatchException` added for signature size validation.
- **Stamps & Form Fields**:
  - Access X/Y indent of `ImageStamp`.
  - New constructor for `TextBoxField` with rectangle array.
- **HTML Font Handling**: `HtmlSaveOptions::SaveFullFont` updated with new getter/setter methods for cleaner property control.

#### Enhancement

- Property simplifications: `Rectangle::Empty` now accessed via `get_Empty()` static method.
- Refined control of font saving behavior for full font or subset.

#### Fix

- No API removals in this version. All updates are additive and backward-compatible.
