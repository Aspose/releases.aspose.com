#### Release Highlights

Aspose.PDF for C++ 24.9 brings powerful graphical comparison tools, PDF crash diagnostics, and support for advanced image integration. The update aligns the C++ API with Aspose.PDF for .NET 24.9, adding granular bitmap control, PDF version targeting, and image diff utilities.

#### New Feature

- **Graphical PDF Comparison**: Introduced `GraphicalPdfComparer` and `ImagesDifference` classes to enable **page-level visual diffing**, PDF export, and image-based comparison.
- **BitmapInfo Class**: Allows importing and manipulating **raw pixel data** for image rendering and PDF content creation.
- **Crash Report Handling**: Added `CrashReportOptions` and related APIs for structured crash logging and diagnostics.
- **PDF Version Selection**: Specify target PDF version directly via the constructor using `PdfVersion` enum.
- **Enhanced Image Control**: Support for stream-based saving of layers and bitmap filtering using `XImageCollection::Add()` overloads.

#### Enhancement

- **Improved Image Rendering**: Better metafile rendering quality and control over color output.
- **Matrix Utilities**: Added `Matrix::GetFlipMatrix()` to support transformations such as mirror effects.
- **Error Tracking**: Added `PdfException::GenerateCrashReport()` for automatic structured crash analysis.

#### Fix

- Flatten methods for **annotations and form fields** were deprecated to streamline internal rendering and simplify field processing.
