### FDF Annotation Support

Version C++ 24.1 of the PDF API introduces FDF annotation support, enabling seamless import of annotations from FDF (Forms Data Format) files into your PDF documents. This streamlines the integration of external annotation data and allows a more efficient development workflow.

### Improved Loading Flexibility

You can better manage the loading process of PDF documents and customize settings by specifying load options, providing flexibility in handing PDFs in your C++ applications.
