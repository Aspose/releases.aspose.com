#### Release Highlights

Aspose.PDF for C++ 24.10 for macOS empowers developers to import CorelDRAW files, validate shape bounds during rendering, and utilize stream-based image injection. Now aligned with the .NET 24.10 engine, optimized for macOS Monterey and later.

#### New Feature

- **CDR Import on macOS**: Convert `.CDR` graphics to PDF using `CdrLoadOptions` directly on macOS systems.
- **Bounds Validation APIs**: Introduced `CheckBounds()` methods to avoid overflows when rendering on Apple platforms.
- **BoundsCheckableList Structure**: Leverage structured drawing lists for **layout integrity** and exception-aware output.
- **Custom Crash Reports**: Generate crash reports tailored for macOS environments using `CrashReportOptions`.
- **Rectangle Geometry Testing**: Enhanced containment checks via strict `Contains()` parameter.

#### Enhancement

- **Streamlined Image API**: New `AddImage()` overloads support streams and HOCR across macOS workflows.
- **Mirrored Drawing Support**: Use `Matrix::GetFlipMatrix()` to flip content in rotated or symmetrical layouts.

#### Fix

- Removed legacy image and shape APIs in favor of modern, layout-safe options suited for macOS PDF rendering and export stability.
