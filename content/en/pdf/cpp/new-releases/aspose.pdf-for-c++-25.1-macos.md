#### Release Highlights

Aspose.PDF for C++ 25.1 on macOS enables comprehensive signature validation, field flattening, and layout positioning using `FloatingBox`. This update empowers PDF automation on macOS with streamlined digital signing and rendering workflows.

#### New Feature

- **Signature Validation on macOS**:
  - Leverage `ValidationOptions`, `ValidationResult`, and status enums.
  - Choose between `OCSP`, `CRL`, and combined methods for PDF signing verification.
- **Redaction & Field Flattening**: Securely apply redactions and flatten form fields to prevent tampering.
- **FloatingBox Layout Control**: `PositioningMode::Absolute` offers pixel-perfect layout support.
- **HTML Raster Mode**: Disable raster image export in HTML rendering using `DontSave` mode in `HtmlSaveOptions`.

#### Enhancement

- PDF layout precision on macOS with `FloatingBox` positioning and form field finalization for print-ready exports.
