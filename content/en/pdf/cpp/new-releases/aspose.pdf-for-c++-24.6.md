This release of Aspose.PDF for C++ (version 24.6) allows developers to take their PDF document processing solutions to the next level by introducing important enhancements and fixes. We have improved the efficiency of saving PDFs to multipage TIFF files, enabling you to create larger TIFFs (over 2GB) at double the speed.

### Enhanced PDF to Multipage TIFF Conversion

Experience a significant performance boost (2x faster) while saving PDFs to multipage TIFF files with this release of the C++ PDF API. Now you can also create TIFFs exceeding 2GB in size.

### New Text PDF Comparer Class

The newÂ `TextPdfComparer` class in Aspose.PDF for C++ 24.6 empowers you to perform in-depth text comparisons between PDF documents. Analyze page-by-page differences, identify insertions and deletions, generate detailed comparison statistics, and do much more.

### Improved Text Extraction from Repaired PDFs

The `Document.Repair` method has been refined to provide more control over the repair process in the latest PDF library version. Utilize the new `RepairOptions` class to specify whether to restore indirect object generations during repairs.
