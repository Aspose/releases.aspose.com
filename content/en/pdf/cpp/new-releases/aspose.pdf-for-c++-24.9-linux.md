#### Release Highlights

Aspose.PDF for C++ 24.9 for Linux introduces visual PDF comparison, low-level bitmap access, and structured crash reporting for enhanced debugging in server environments. Fully aligned with the .NET 24.9 engine.

#### New Feature

- **Graphical Comparison**: Use `GraphicalPdfComparer` to visually compare PDF pages or entire documents.
- **BitmapInfo API**: Process and inject raw image bytes directly into PDFs for advanced rendering control.
- **CrashReportOptions**: Enable structured crash logging and diagnostics tailored for Linux deployments.
- **PDF Version Control**: Set output compatibility using `PdfVersion` enum on document initialization.

#### Enhancement

- **CLI Compatibility**: All new APIs tested with **Clang 3.9.1+** and standard Linux-based toolchains.
- **Image Handling**: Enhanced support for color format conversion and stream-based bitmap import/export.

#### Fix

- Removed obsolete `Flatten()` methods from annotations and form fields to prevent incompatibility with Linux-specific rendering layers.
