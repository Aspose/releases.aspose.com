### Elevate Python PDF Page Manipulation

With Aspose.PDF for Python via Java 23.10, you can gain finer control over PDF page structure with the introduction of the new `BaseParagraph` and `Paragraphs` classes.

### Simplified API Methods

You can now work with PDFs more efficiently thanks to renamed methods like pages and `optimize_resources` for clearer understanding.

### Streamlined Development

Experience a more intuitive and developer-friendly API for seamless PDF management in Python with the latest PDF manipulation API release.

### Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

### New classes in Api.py:

- class BaseParagraph(Assist.BaseJavaClass)
- class Paragraphs(Assist.BaseJavaClass)

### New classes in `Page` class:

- def paragraphs(self) -> Paragraphs
- def add(self, page: Page = None) -> Page
- def insert(self, index, page: Page = None) -> Page
- def delete(self, index)

### Renamed API members:

- `getPages` is now renamed to pages for a more intuitive representation.
- `optimizeResources` is now `optimize_resources` for better code clarity.
- `saveInBytes` is now `save_in_bytes` to adhere to Pythonic naming conventions.
- `get_Item` is now `get_item` for a more consistent naming style.
