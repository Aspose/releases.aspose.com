#### Release Highlights

The DLLs-only release of Aspose.Note for .NET 25.3 includes a vital fix that improves how InkML (Ink Markup Language) content is rendered when exporting OneNote documents to PDF. This ensures greater fidelity when working with handwritten notes and sketches.

### ðŸ›  Fix

- **InkML Export Accuracy**  
  Addressed a critical issue where InkML inputâ€”such as stylus or pen-based annotationsâ€”was not rendering as expected in PDF output. The fix now supports correct rendering of these elements in document exports.
