## **Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes**
The following is a list of any changes made to the public API such as added, renamed, removed or deprecated members as well as any non-backward compatible change made to Aspose.Note for .NET.

Added new interfaces for child nodes.

To provide correct document structure almost all composite nodes now have more strict type of child nodes unlike the base type Node previously.

Section and PageSeries were removed.

All properties which correspond to the Section node were moved to the Document (CreationTime,Color,DisplayName,Guid). Pages from the PageSeries node moved to the document's children and are accessible through the IEnumerable interface implemented by the Document type.

Added Page.Title property.

New Title property of the Page type was added to set page's title, unlike appending Title instance to the children collection.

CompositeNode was converted into a generic type.

To increase clarity of the OneNote composite node, old non-generic class was converted to a generic class with an interface INode constraint of the type parameter.

IsTitleText, IsTitleDate and IsTitleTime properties of the RichText type were marked as obsolete.

The correct structure of Title's childrens contains RichText nodes for the title's text, date or time. Now these objects are accessible through TitleText, TitleDate and TitleTime properties respectively.

TableColumn.Ordinal was marked as obsolete.

To specify an order for the columns the Table.Children property should be used.

Table.Rows was marked as obsolete.

The property provides a read only list of rows. To change rows collection AppendChild and RemoveChild methods should be used.
