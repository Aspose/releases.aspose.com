#### Release Highlights

The DLLs-only release of Aspose.GIS for .NET 24.11 introduces new raster rendering capabilities and enhanced database integration with full transactional and parameterized support.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **Raster Support with World Files**:
  - New drivers:
    - `Drivers.JpegW`, `PngW`, `BmpW`, `TiffW` to open JPEG/PNG/TIFF images with geo-referenced world files.
  - Enables mixing vector + raster layers in rendering.

- **Feature Index Querying**:
  - `VectorLayer.FindIndex()` allows fast lookup of a feature's index by a custom predicate‚Äîideal for editing and conditional updates.

### üîß Enhancement

- **SQL Parameter Binding**:
  - Database data sources now accept dictionaries of SQL parameters during `ReadAsync`, supporting safe and dynamic queries.

- **ReadAsync with Transactions**:
  - You can now perform full-layer read operations inside a transaction context for data integrity and rollback support.

### üõ† Fix

- **SpatialReferenceSystem Null on Geometry Ops**:
  - Fixed issue where the `SRS` was lost during `Intersection()` operations.

- **Incorrect SQL Behavior**:
  - Addressed problem where `ReplaceAt()` issued DELETE + INSERT instead of an UPDATE, preserving database key consistency.
