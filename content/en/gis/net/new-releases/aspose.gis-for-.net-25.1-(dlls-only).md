#### Release Highlights

The DLLs-only release of Aspose.GIS for .NET 25.1 empowers developers with OSM editing capabilities, advanced in-memory layer loading, and critical format reliability fixes.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è New Feature

- **OSM XML File Editing**:
  - Create, modify, and update OpenStreetMap `.osm` layers.
  - Smart duplicate handling via tag-based feature merging.
  - Fully compatible with OSM tools and workflows.

- **MultiStreamPath for Stream-Based GIS Files**:
  - Load multi-part GIS formats like `.shp`, `.dbf`, `.prj` from streams via a unified `MultiStreamPath`.
  - Enables dynamic GIS data handling, embedded storage, and testing without disk access.

### üîß Enhancement

- **AbstractPath Upgrade**:
  - `MultiStreamPath` extends `AbstractPath`, allowing logical grouping of GIS component files in memory.
  - Optimized for containerized environments and secure data workflows.

### üõ† Fix

- **Resaved OSM Files Remain Valid**:
  - Corrected serialization logic ensures `.osm` files saved with Aspose.GIS remain readable and intact.
