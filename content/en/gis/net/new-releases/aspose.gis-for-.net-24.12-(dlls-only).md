#### Release Highlights

Aspose.GIS for .NET 24.12 DLLs improve developer efficiency by eliminating the need for raw SQL, simplifying map rendering, and fixing tag loss in OSM workflows.

### ✳️ New Feature

- **Schema-Driven DB Access (No SQL Required)**:
  - Create editable GIS layers from a table definition using:
    - `FromDefinition(string tableName)`
    - `AddAttribute()`, `IdentityAttribute()`, `GeometryField()`
    - Full async data layer creation and commit with `SubmitChangesAsync()`
  - Ideal for CRUD operations directly on GIS databases such as PostGIS.

- **Automatic Map Dimensioning**:
  - Initialize `new Map()` without parameters and let Aspose.GIS infer optimal render size from spatial layer extents.
  - Supports mixed vector/raster rendering.

### 🔧 Enhancement

- *No general enhancements were logged beyond the main feature set.*

### 🛠 Fix

- **OSM Node Tag Copy Bug**:
  - Now ensures complete tag transfer when copying nodes from one `.osm` file to another using `Drivers.OsmXml`.
