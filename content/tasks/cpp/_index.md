A standalone C++ library that enables the C++ developers to [generate, update, render, & convert project files](https://products.aspose.com/tasks/cpp/) from within C++ projects without Microsoft Project&reg;.

## Why download Aspose.Tasks for C++?

Aspose.Tasks for C++ is a native class library to help you quickly build C++ apps that can read, write, manipulate, and convert Microsoft Project&reg; file formats (MPP, MPT, MPX, and XML Project Format) without dependency on installing Microsoft Project&reg; or any other 3rd party components.

It helps you work with Microsoft Project&reg; formulas, tasks, task links, calendars, calendar exceptions, resources, resource assignment, currencies, and VBA information. You can import and export project data to Primavera file formats (XML, XER, MPX) as well. Aspose.Tasks for C++ offers to convert your project data into a variety of formats, including Excel, HTML, SVG, JPEG, BMP, PDF and more.

This distribution package contains both the 32-bit as well as the 64-bit binaries for the MS Windows. The shared libraries for Linux-based OS are also available and are built with GCC-6 and CLang-3. It supports x86 and x64 based applications on Windows and x64 based applications on Linux.
