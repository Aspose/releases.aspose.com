# Reduced SVG Size produced via Vectorization

The use of quadratic beziers instead of cubic beziers and replacing the relative path commands with absolute ones has successfully optimized the document size of SVG files produced via text vectorization. Now the vectorized files have less than half the size of the previously produced SVGs.

# Reduced Loading Time of SVG Documents

The direct loading of SVG `dtd` (Document Type Definition) schemas from the Aspose.SVG assembly has considerably reduced the time it takes to load the SVG documents. Previously the schemas were being downloaded from the online resources, which has been replaced by this optimized approach.
