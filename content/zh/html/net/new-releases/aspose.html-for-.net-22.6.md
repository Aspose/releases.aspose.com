# Improved HTML to JPG Conversion

Introduced some improvements in the HTML to JPG image conversion, as previously the text was getting offset to the top-left of the image. The following C# sample code works as HTML to JPG converter via API.

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Html.Converters;
using Aspose.Html.Rendering.Image;
using Aspose.Html.Saving;
...
    // Invoke the ConvertHTML method to convert the HTML code to JPG image           
    Converter.ConvertHTML(@"<h1>Convert HTML to JPG!</h1>", ".", new ImageSaveOptions(ImageFormat.Jpeg), Path.Combine(OutputDir, "convert-with-single-line.jpg"));
```

> Improved the processing of the JS and AngularJS applications.
