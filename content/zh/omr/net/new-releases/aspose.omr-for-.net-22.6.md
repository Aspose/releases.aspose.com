# Container Element Rendering

Improved rendering of container elements ([text markup](https://docs.aspose.com/omr/net/txt-markup/container/) / [JSON markup](https://docs.aspose.com/omr/net/json-markup/container/)) to make the left and right margins within the printable OMR Form equal.

# Improved Barcode Recognition near Page Bottom

Previously it was observed that if the resolution of the original printable form is greater that that of scanned or photographed forms then the barcodes placed at the bottom of the page was not correct recognized. This issue has now been resolved.

# Bubble Coloring in Custom Answer Sheet

Improved the handling of bubble coloring for CustomAnswerSheet element ([text markup](https://docs.aspose.com/omr/net/txt-markup/custom_answer_sheet/) / [JSON markup](https://docs.aspose.com/omr/net/json-markup/customanswersheet/)).

# Recognition of Multi-page PDF / TIFF

Introduced a workaround to perform multi page recognition for PDF and TIFF files, where each page of the filled form is put in a separate scanned file and recognized one by one.
