# Improved Handling of Link Annotation

Modify link annotation and set action as none or null.

# Memory Efficient EPUB Conversion

It was observed that in some instances the loading of `EPUB` for conversion was taking all memory of the System. This issue has now been resolved.

Previously, the Multibyte Characters were not being displayed. This issue has now been resolved.

# Improved HTML to PDF Conversion

Introduced various aspects of HTML to PDF conversion, such as:

- Position of text elements
- Text formatting
