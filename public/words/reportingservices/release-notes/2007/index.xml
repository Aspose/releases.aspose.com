This allows to apply different inline formatting such as or italic within the same textbox. Moreover, you can insert almost any HTML you wish!

This release officially introduces our new technology of smart export of reports to Microsoft Word documents called AWesomeExport. Currently it allows to convert tables and matrices in original reports to &amp;ldquo;native&amp;rdquo; tables in Microsoft Word documents (rather than to a bunch of textboxes) which makes the output much more natural and easy to edit. Note this behaviour is enabled by default starting with this release.</description></item><item><title>Aspose.Words for Reporting Services 1.0.2.0 Hot Fix Release Notes</title><link>https://releases-qa.aspose.com/words/reportingservices/release-notes/2007/aspose-words-reporting-services-1-0-2-0-hot-fix-release-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://releases-qa.aspose.com/words/reportingservices/release-notes/2007/aspose-words-reporting-services-1-0-2-0-hot-fix-release-notes/</guid><description>This page contains release notes for Aspose.Words Reporting Services 1.0.2.0 Hot Fix

This release addresses several minor issues reported by customers. In particular, rendering of complex nested subreports was improved. Nested subreports containing tables often result in a deep hierarchy of nested tables in Microsoft Word documents. Starting with v1.0.4, the tables are &amp;ldquo;really&amp;rdquo; nested (containing each other) which fixes the layout and simplifies editing - for example, inner (child) tables are moved together with the outer (parent) table when positioning it in the document.</description></item><item><title>Aspose.Words for Reporting Services 1.1.0.0 New Release Notes</title><link>https://releases-qa.aspose.com/words/reportingservices/release-notes/2007/aspose-words-reporting-services-1-1-0-0-new-release-release-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://releases-qa.aspose.com/words/reportingservices/release-notes/2007/aspose-words-reporting-services-1-1-0-0-new-release-release-notes/</guid><description>This page contains release notes for Aspose.Words Reporting Services 1.1.0.0 New Release

We have decided to jump from 1.1 to 1.2 without publishing any minor hotfixes mainly because we added a very important and expected feature. That was briskly demanded by many users and we just could not leave their requests without attention. Note both deployment options (MSI installer and zip package) now include two assemblies, one for Reporting Services 2000 and the other for Reporting Services 2005.</description></item><item><title>Aspose.Words for Reporting Services 1.2.1.0 Hot Fix Release Notes</title><link>https://releases-qa.aspose.com/words/reportingservices/release-notes/2007/aspose-words-reporting-services-1-2-1-0-hot-fix-release-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://releases-qa.aspose.com/words/reportingservices/release-notes/2007/aspose-words-reporting-services-1-2-1-0-hot-fix-release-notes/</guid><description>This page contains release notes for Aspose.Words Reporting Services 1.2.1.0 Hot Fix

MSI installer requires .NET Framework 1.1 to run. Now the installer supports any version of .NET Framework installed on the target machine.
Apart of this fix, the release includes minor memory optimizations and code refactorings that do not affect the functionality of the product.</description></item><item><title>Aspose.Words for Reporting Services 1.3.0.0 New Release Notes</title><link>https://releases-qa.aspose.com/words/reportingservices/release-notes/2007/aspose-words-reporting-services-1-3-0-0-new-release-release-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://releases-qa.aspose.com/words/reportingservices/release-notes/2007/aspose-words-reporting-services-1-3-0-0-new-release-release-notes/</guid><description>This page contains release notes for Aspose.Words Reporting Services 1.3.0.0 New Release
