This release introduces an amazing feature never offered before. Now the installation package includes two assemblies that allow you to add Microsoft Word formats to the Microsoft Report Viewer control working in local mode! Just add a reference to an appropriate assembly (depending on the version of the control - 2005 or 2008) and implement a short method as described in the documentation - and you will notice additional export format appeared on the dropdown list.</description></item><item><title>Aspose.Words for Reporting Services 2.2.0.0 Release Notes</title><link>https://releases-qa.aspose.com/words/reportingservices/release-notes/2008/aspose-words-for-reporting-services-2-2-0-0-release-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://releases-qa.aspose.com/words/reportingservices/release-notes/2008/aspose-words-for-reporting-services-2-2-0-0-release-notes/</guid><description>This page contains release notes for Aspose.Words for Reporting Services 2.2.0.0
This release introduces two new export formats - now you are able to export your RDL reports to Web pages (HTML) and plain text (TXT), apart of the &amp;ldquo;native&amp;rdquo; Microsoft Word formats such as DOC, DOCX, RTF and WordML. Another noticeable improvement is the support of bookmarks, labels and actions which are now exported to Word documents as appropriate.</description></item><item><title>Aspose.Words for Reporting Services 2.1.0.0 Release Notes</title><link>https://releases-qa.aspose.com/words/reportingservices/release-notes/2008/aspose-words-for-reporting-services-2-1-0-0-release-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://releases-qa.aspose.com/words/reportingservices/release-notes/2008/aspose-words-for-reporting-services-2-1-0-0-release-notes/</guid><description>
