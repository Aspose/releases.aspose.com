Introduction
In this release, the feature &amp;lsquo;PDF Linearization&amp;rsquo; (sometimes called &amp;lsquo;Web Optimized&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Fast Web View&amp;rsquo;) is supported. The idea behind linearization is faster display of PDF documents downloaded from the web. If you&amp;rsquo;re developing a Web-based system that creates large PDF files for delivery to web browsers over the Internet, you should try to make sure that your system can generate linearized PDF files.</description></item></channel></rss>
